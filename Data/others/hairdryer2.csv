Quick & Quiet!","When my old Remington dryer that is 7 years old broke I started looking for a replacement, needless to say I ended up returning 4 dryers before I found this one. I loved my old dryer because it was so quiet, I can't stand the dryers that have a high pitched whining noise. So I called Remington & they told me this was the quietest dryer they make (they measure by decibels & this dryer had the lowest). So I bought it & it is super quiet, the motor doesn't really give off any noise the only sound you hear is the airflow. And the airflow on this dryer is super strong, its much stronger than my last dryer so it does dry your hair pretty quick. I am very pleased with this product. It comes with a 4 year warranty too. The hot setting is hot but its nice because it doesn't get hot enough wear it feels like its burning your scalp. I actually bought mine at walmart online for $27, it was such a great deal! I highly recommend this dryer, its great.","5/11/2010",0.891834612416234,2.26728953710468,0.855872249243223,0.76329649568164

I wanted to wait to give any reviews till I used this for awhile and I must say that it hasn't scored any points for length of use. I thought maybe if I continued to use it, my hair would improve from being dry, but it hasn't.<br /><br />This dryer has a low and high speed setting, and low, medium and hot heat settings. The low setting dryed my hair as fast as a cheaper dryer and the high speed setting is probably enough to even dry clothes rather quickly! It packs a punch! After using all three heat settings, I found that medium works best although hot doesn't get as hot as most other dryers I've tried and those tend to actually burn the hair. There's also a cool shot feature that works great if you're using the hot setting and want an instant cool down.<br /><br />The attachments are an Airflow diffuser and an Airflow concentrator. Both of these work well if you either want a wide spread airflow or a concentrated one. The concentrated one works good if you're using either a brush or curlers and want the air concentrated on that particular spot. The wide spread one is simply if you want a wider area of airflow, such as if you have really long hair.<br /><br />I thought that the tourmaline feature would make it somehow better for my hair, but I haven't noticed any improvement over other standard (and less expensive) hair dryers. This is my biggest dissapointment with this one and why I waited over 3 months to submit a review.<br /><br />On the plus side, the filter hasn't clogged yet or gotten any hair in it at all! This is amazing, since with other dryers I've used, it didn't take long at all before hair would start gathering in the filter. This one also has a removable filter, but as of yet I haven't needed to clean it.<br /><br />This is also heavier than most dryers, so if you have weak arms or otherwise have trouble holding something rather heavy for the length of time that it would take to dry your hair, this one probably isn't for you. However, if you want to do something a little extra to help build muscle in your arms, this will do it! It weighs under a pound, but compared to other dryers, it weighs about 1/3 more on average. This is also quieter than most dryers I've used. More time will tell on how durable it is, but the way this is constructed, I have no doubts that it will last a long time.<br /><br />I'm giving this 3 stars due to the good features it has, but for the cost of the money and the seemingly better for your hair impressions that it seems it should have, it didn't score there. It remains just above average.you. However, if you want to do something a little extra to help build muscle in your arms, this will do it!

I'm tell you all this because the keratin treatment is supposed to significantly reduce the drying time of your hair, and it does. So, while I did notice a shorter drying time with this dryer than with my other ones, it wasn't a really valid measure of how much better and faster it was, because any dryer is pretty fast for me now.    I decided to use the dryer on my daughter's long, thick, wavy hair. The unit got to be a bit heavy - it wasn't noticeable for my hair because it was such a short drying time (7 minutes?) but not as bad as many other full sized dryers that I've used. This one is a smaller unit, but it is loud. It did successfully dry my daughter's long hair in 1/3-1/2 the usual time. And, her hair was shinier and softer than with a regular dryer. I am assuming that's from the tourmaline and/or ceramic as we used the same conditioner's we've always used.

My hair is thick, with a wave, and it absolutely mushrooms after blowdrying or in high humidity. It takes forever to dry my hair, so naturally your weary arms tick up the heat factor to get it DRY already, and that in turn ups the frizz factor.    I must say, I was impressed. The dryer features several heat and style settings, so to give an honest portrayal of the results, I kept the heat on the equivalent settings as my usual blow dryer. Then, after a while when my arms would usually get tired, I increased the volume setting.    Unfortunately, with this blow dryer, I wasn't faking the exhaustion in my arms. This isn't the heaviest blow dryer I've ever used, but it's up there! If there was such a thing as getting muscled from using blow dryers, I'd be Ahnold already. I wasn't faking it when I reached the point in the blow drying when my arms were saying, Enough already!    The dryer is more than enough power to accomplish the job. What was interesting was after my hair was dry, it really WAS less frizzy than the same routine done with my usual blower dryer.    The second time I tried it, it was raining out and about a billion percent humidity, the perfect laboratory for determining if all the tourmaline/titanium/ceramic add-ons actually worked to keep hair smooth.    It kind of did. What I can say was my hair frizzed, but it frizzed LESS, and it was much shinier than I've ever seen my hair in humid weather. I guess that's an endorsement, but not enough of one where one might forgo a flat iron to flatten out the kinks.     The dryer comes with a diffuser, which I've always found to be WAY too much work and time (if your arms hurt with regular blow drying, you'll be crippled when you're done using a diffuser on thick hair!)    If you're in the market for a blow dryer, and you have a problem with the frizzes, you might want to give the Remington serious consideration. It did a nice job for me, but the gold standard - not having to use a flat iron - remains elusive, even with this dryer.","5/14/2009",0.776785714285714,2.8276612321263,0.851591226943517,0.661503899500767

I can only guess that this is because if the heat setting is on high there has to be a minimum amount of fan strength to keep the unit from catching fire.<br /><br />I imagine that a professional hair stylist has the advantage of being able to hold the dryer some distance away from a customer's head and that's why it's so hot and blows so strong, but of course someone using it on themselves doesn't have that advantage.<br /><br />Ceramic is nice, as well as the ion emissions.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Despite complaining about the strength of the fan, she already tossed her old dryer and uses this one because it is a professional level item.

I'm not sure I would love it if I needed to use a dryer on a daily basis but for the occasional quick dry user it is fine. Another possible issue if you don't have very long arms you may find the nozzle too long with the directional attachment in place.

The dryer has a nice heft to it and doesn't feel cheap, but isn't overly cumbersome either. It dries my hair very well, and seems to keep frizz to a minimum thanks to it's lower heat and air settings. The dryer definitely makes noise on high, but it's not as loud as most I've encountered, so for me it's a non-issue. The attachments included seem to stay put for me, I've had no problems with them falling off or coming loose while using the dryer. The switches have a solid feel to them, are well placed too, reducing the chance of accidentally changing the settings.     One difference I've noticed compared to other dryers I've used is when changing the heat settings on this dryer, the fan motor doesn't speed up or slow down any at all. With other dryers if you turn the heat up the fan sounds like it slows some, and turn the heat down the fan sounds like it speeds up a little. Perhaps that is one of the advantages of having an AC fan motor instead of a DC motor that is wired into the heating elements via a rectifier circuit in the hair dryer, less stress and voltage spikes/sags to shorten the life of the fan motor.    The only issues I could think of is the cord is not as long as I'd like it to be. Another 2 or 3 feet of length in the power cord would make a huge difference for the better.     The low heat setting on the dryer seems to be cooler than the low heat setting on all the other dryers I've used i.e. it's barely warmer than ambient air temperature. Whether that's a plus or a minus should be left up to the individual user. For me, it works better this way, so it isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I felt it worth mentioning.","5/7/2009",0.987632519528682,2.29730487632092,0.850107139212952,0.839593455770208

I found the large attachment for spreading the heat over the entire head especially helpful for when I wanted to dry the hair without blowing it. Blow-drying also worked well, with ample heat to get the job done. The instant cool button would be helpful to a professional, but the heat-adjustment switch is sufficient for me, a casual user. The motor is pleasantly quiet.<br /><br />The only slight quibble I have with it is that the safety feature built into the power cord makes for an extra layer of on-off; and until I learned which button was on and which was emergency off I found myself fumbling around for half a minute before I could actually turn the dryer on. (It's not intuitively obvious whether a red button should mean hot, and therefore on, or whether it is red as for a panic button to turn the device off; or whether the reset button is to reset the unit to on or to reset it to off.)","5/4/2009",0.552642962667622,3.317975901722,0.850107139212952,0.469805727999542

The heat is sufficient and it dries my hair quickly.  I have straight medium thick hair and it usually takes longer with my other hair dryer, so this is a huge plus.  My daughter has very curly and extremely THICK hair and wants to take this dryer from me.  It works wonders on her hair and cuts her dry time in half.    We are very pleased with the Remington D-2012 dryer but if there were to be modifications in the future it would be to perhaps make it lighter and quieter.  If you want fast, salon dry hair, this is a great purchase.","5/4/2009",0.537365815093191,1.75331912858781,0.850107139212952,0.456818515779709

The hair dryer is pretty heavy compared to some of the other ones on the market, additionally the low speed setting still blows your hair too much, making it harder to style your hair. However, it does come with a diffuser which is something that you don't normally get with a blow dryer.","5/1/2009",0.269659685815003,1.95885188366026,0.850107139212952,0.229239624069256

Whether or not it is comparable to a CHI, I don't know.  I DO know it is half the price of a CHI, and unlike Farouk (who makes the CHI), Remington will honor the warranty if you buy it on the internet.  The CHI is a solid product so not many people get bitten by the voided warranty when you buy on Amazon, but there's always that chance.<br /><br />The D-2012 has two air speeds and three heat settings.  I use middle heat + low airflow for my short guy hair.  My wife uses high heat + low or high airflow for her long thick hair.  She says it drys so fast that her hair is dry before she has finished styling it.<br /><br />The dryer has a very solid, commercial grade feel to it.  Read this to mean it's heavy compared with basic hair dryers.  I find it to be quieter than my wife's old dryer that claimed to be quiet.<br /><br />All in all this product is a winner if you are looking for a really good solid hair dryer but you don't have the coin for a CHI.  This hair dryer is likely one of the best in the sub $50 category.","4/27/2009",0.820905681923241,3.45986625055226,0.857244894488526,0.70371720468532

Slightly heavier than my Healthy Infusions by Wahl Pro Dryer it my opinion. Seems nothing special.<br /><br />I don't like the long nozzle.

Comparable to my Healthy Infusions by Wahl Pro Dryer, it's about the same.<br /><br />No swivel cord. Buttons feel a bit cheap, but I guess it's a hair dryer... nothing fancy here.<br /><br />No, it's not quiet.

I blow my curly hair straight and then flat iron it smooth.  My old cheapo dryers would create a mushroom-shaped pouf on my head, which, in turn, would take forever to flat iron out.  This dryer makes my hair noticeably smoother (and much less freaky!) and cuts my time with the flat iron in half!  I did give it four stars instead of five because it is slightly on the heavy side, but not so heavy that I would return it.  I would purchase it again.
