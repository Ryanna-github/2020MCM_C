We are currently on the third microwave from LG. The first microwave failed after 2 weeks.  It took 2 weeks for LG to get us a new microwave.  The next microwave lasted 11 months.  It went out on thanksgiving, we bought a 69.00 off brand microwave, it has worked perfectly for last 18 months. The LG failed again after 18 months.  Lowes and Home Depot should replace microwave.  Reading the blog, I have never had a brand of microwave failed this often.  I am going to take LG to court.  They have to know there is a major problem, if so many failures, yet they continued producing this worthless piece of junk.  This appears to be another bean counter situation, cheaper to give new machine and fix damage, than recall product.
This microwave has every button in the world except a simple timer. We used our microwave timer for everything. It's so stupid that a microwave this expensive doesn't include a basic kitchen timer.
Extremly satisfied
Love LG products. Got product in a timely manner.
This has been a good microwave for us. Sure the paint has peeled inside, but for us it was only after 2-3 years. I just scraped it off; it is not needed for cooking. The thing that we really like is that the styling on the front completely matches our Jenn-aire stove right below it. Cooking wise, it has been fine, and heavily used for many years. It is now reaching end of life, and I am struggling to find a replacement that fits the space and matches the stove.
3yrs and counting. So far so good!
Install was really easy, and the microwave looks and works great. The buttons are really touch sensitive and it seems to clean very easily.
Just installed it  that part was easy
I've had this microwave for 10 months, and already the handle broke (apparently like everyone else's).  Dealing with the Bosch customer service group has been horrible...required like 8 phone calls to get a replacement part ordered under warranty, and then they wanted $99 for a tech to install it.  I finally convinced them to just send me the part for free so I could install it myself.  After removing the plastic trim from the inside, discovered that the screw holding the top part of the handle is behind a metal piece that seemed impossible to remove.  I just drilled through the metal and was able to get it done.  Whew!
I had the older version 2083ST and it stopped working so I replaced it with this microwave - has identical size and older model does not exist.<br /><br />Two aspects were problematic from the prior model - one of the mounting screws was located in the wrong position, thankfully the wall bracket and one of the screws aligned perfectly. So had to drill one more screw. However, the two screws are not symmetrical i..e the distance from the sides of the microwave are different. This is bad engineering, as the center of gravity is not the center.<br />Second, the interior is grey, so we cannot be see the food cooking. Moreover, the bottom of the outside panel is tinted (or black) so unless you are 6 ft tall, you cannot see the very dark interior with very small light.<br />Further, the microwave arrived with the mounting bracket (which was located at the top of the microwave carton) bent; thankfully, we had the older one, we did not have to use it.<br />Overall, disappointed with LG design and there is no backward compatibility with older models.
This is a nice looking unit. It arrived right on schedule and was well packaged, so no damage. Plus, all the features seem to work. I particularly like that the fan seems to be quieter than my old unit. My only complaint was, as noted by a couple of others, the installation instructions had the screws in the wrong places. Fortunately, I didn't do the install myself, a pro did it--or the micro would have been on the way back to &#34;home&#34;! The unit matches my other LG appliances, so, I'm pretty happy. I'll update this after I've used the micro for a while. Ta. y'all.
This microwave has been decent, until today. The plastic piece that holds that handle on is extremely thin. After a year or two or light/normal use, it breaks. If you read reviews, you will see others complaining about the same issue. The part costs around $16, but I'm not sure how to replace it as the back of the screw is covered by the door. Annoying.
does not keep ice cold . if you like cold drinks don't purchase . great cool collectable but it functional
I've had this microwave for 26 months. In that time I replaced the light under the microwave maybe 4 times. Sometimes it burned out, other times it exploded, but it seemed odd that that thing kept going. My previous cheapo microwave worked for 5 years and only needed the bulb changed twice.<br /><br />Then last night the light popped and the microwave blew the fuse. Since then, the fan and light have completely stopped working. The oven itself still works, but it makes me super uncomfortable how quiet it is as it heats, does it need the fan? Does it need to vent? I don't know. But I know after all the other comments I'm not reading on Amazon, that I'm not comfortable finding out.<br /><br />When I called LG, they asked if it was plugged in. I explained that the microwave worked, but not the fan or the lightbulb. She said it was probably my outlet. Not very helpful. When I called a repairman, he said fixing it would cost $200. Ugh, looks like I&#34;m in the market for a new microwave.
I wish I could give this zero stars. Bought this last year to go with my kitchen remodel. Every appliance I own is LG, washer and dryer included. Luckily, they still work. I work ALL the time and prefer my food grilled. I rarely use the microwave. Just bought it as a just in case method of heating leftovers. My microwave died today. Just stopped heating. Everything else apparently works on it. Apparently, a faulty magnetron is a wide spread occurrence. I did a live chat with an online rep. She wanted to send me to a service tech over an hour away. I declined. I explained to her similar issues from most owners of this model and stated this should be looked at as being recalled. No way we all messed up our units. I forwarded her to the Amazon reviews. She was basically like yeah, ok, do you want me to find you a service center? At the end of our conversation, she just ended the session. I wasnt finished chatting with her. I will NEVER buy an LG appliance<br /><br />Chat log:<br />Chat Transcript<br />Time of chat: 7/2/2015 4:54:35 PM<br />Length of chat: 00:18:41<br />Your name: rafael vazquez<br />Chatted with: Michelle, Paulsen<br /><br />4:54 PM Michelle: Hello rafael vazquez.

Installed easily and looks great. It's only been in use for about a month but we have no complaints. Fan is quiet.
I purchased this in 2010 and it worked great. Then a couple of weeks ago I came into the kitchen and saw the SE error code. I wasn't able to set the clock so I unplugged it and started researching what the error code meant. As you have probably read in other reviews, this is a common Samsung problem. The steam from cooking on the stove underneath the microwave damages the cooking sensor which causes the entire oven to malfunction. And please understand that I haven't used my stove top for cooking on a regular basis!<br /><br />After a couple of hours, I plugged it in to see what happened and was able to set the clock and use it. I was thrilled but cautious. Which was good because within 10 minutes I heard the microwave beep and start cooking. I shut it off and watched it and within 15 seconds, I saw &#34;Baked Potato&#34; on the screen and it started up again. So now it's unplugged and will be replaced.<br /><br />Samsung says it's out of the warranty period but will send a technician to fix it for more than it will cost me to purchase a new unit. I did get five years out of it so I'm chalking it up to lessons learned - no more Samsung microwaves. When they have this many ovens with the same problem, you would think the company would make things write. To be fair, I have always owned Samsung televisions and been very happy with them. Maybe the microwave business isn't for them?
Horrible waiting for a refund
This  appliance has more problems than perks!  I purchased an extended warranty and later found out it is worthless.  My daughter open the door  and the bottom of the handle broke.  A few nights later the control panel went haywire!!  It beeps and flashes different functions and dates until you unplug it. There is nothing convenient about plugging and unplugging an appliance every time you want to use it. Light-bulbs ( it takes two) costs $6-$7 dollars each and blows out within 24 hours. It seems as if the appliance is experiences a power serge.  (The constant flickering of the lights is very irritating and unsettling.  I would have been better off purchasing a microwave from Walmart.....at least they have a legitimate warranty.
I have owned a suite of Ge Cafe products  ( i.e. refrigerator, stove, microwave and dishwasher ) for approximately 6 years now. My recommendation is stay away. My refrigerator has seen a visit from the repairman four times. My stoves plastic knobs melted off and I was kindly advised by GE that I could now buy new metal ones for $300. My dishwashers dispenser in not dispensing. And now to round things off my microwave's touchpad is not functioning as it should. GE is comping me the parts which the repairman quoted me $1,225.00 and labor at $100.00(my responsibility). I read from other poster's comments that this issue will happen again. I contacted GE, advised them of the cost ,and suggested that I apply my labor cost towards the purchase of a new microwave. I was shot down. New microwave  $750.00 vs paying $1225 for parts??? If I were a  GE shareholder I would be outraged at this type of irresponsible spending. Multiply this type of activity several thousand times over and you're talking serious money. Quality has seriously gone down since the days my parents bought GE products. They have lost a future customer in me and my family. If you're considering this line of products buyers beware.
Stay away!  Bad product.  Expensive repairs. Poor support.<br /><br />I have owned 3 of these. All white not stainless.  I talked a friend into buying a stainless one ( he bought110v - bad move... underpowered ) I love the concept.  But at this point I'd strongly recommend  you stay away from this product.  I'm talking about the 220v Advantium oven.  My experience:<br />I had the house rewired to put this 220v oven above the stove.<br />  The first one I owned lasted about 1 1/2 years, then the bottom heating element (a halogen bulb) burnt out.  I had service replace it.  About 1/2 a year later the controller for the microwave burnt out.  When it worked, it worked great. So, I replaced the whole unit.<br />  The second one was exactly the same design: 220v with halogen bulb lower heating element.  After about 2 years, the halogen bulb again burnt out.  Again after another year, the whole unit broke to the point I again replaced it.<br />  So, I really liked the concept, but obviously the design engineering was bad.  This was severely pointed out in the 3rd 220v unit I bought:  They changed the design!  They replaced the lower halogen heating element with an infrared heating element.  Halogen bulbs are near instant on.  Infrared takes time to heat up.  So, frozen 12&#34; pizza took a bit longer to cook, and all the recipes that relied on bottom heat was off a bit... seemed like they changed the heater characteristics without bothering to reprogram the recipes, but Ok.  I still liked the concept.<br />  Then, the lower now infrared heater failed.  So I called service. They replaced the part.  But now... it wouldn't  even cook a pizza.  Too little power from the lower heating unit.  Service came out to fix it again.  Then, I cooked a pizza in front of the technician that replaced the bulb. The &#34;cooked&#34; pizza came out burnt on the top, and the bottom uncooked: &#34;floppy slices&#34;.  The product after repair, no longer performed it's function.  I had many calls into GE consumer relations.  No help.  At the end, I was told the fixed product worked as designed, and there was nothing more they would do on this unit.  They were willing to sell me a 4th one.  When I asked how it would cook, he didn't know.<br /><br />Love the concept, but bad execution, and expensive and poor support.
Not built to last more than the length of the warranty.  Do not buy.  Anyone giving it high marks has not had it for two years.
How did our landlord get all new appliances and choose this awful contraption?!? The incessant beeping is driving me a little mad and, of course, there's no way to change that. Reviews for this thing being awful go back to 2-4 years ago. Just a little internet search could have saved me from this fate. I hope it dies soon.
This is by far the MOST stupid appliance I have ever come across in all my years.  As you will read in other reviews, the absurdity of its functions has yet to cease angering me on a daily basis.<br /><br />The 3 beeps when things are done cooking - You can not do ANYTHING until it slowly finishes its 3 beeps.  No stop, no cancel, no starting the microwave again or adding time.  You must stand there and listen to its siren song of idiocy.<br /><br />Also, you can't use the timer and use the microwave at the same time. I mean, why?! WTF!<br /><br />Daily I want to rip this thing off the wall and take it into a field Office Space style and beat it with a baseball bat.<br /><br />Anyone want to buy a microwave from me? Cheap!
Absolute junk currently trying to get second version of this microwave fixed or replaced. The first one died emitting a god awful blue smoke. Fortunately we bought the service agreement. Unfortunately still took more than a month to replace.  The replacement is also malfunctioning. The keypad started malfunction then the microwave started smoking now waiting for a resolution. Do  not buy look at consumer reports reviews this thing is a lemon
I purchased this microwave and have had problems since day 1. You can not run timer and microwave at the same time.  Turntable makes a weird noise and continues to get worse.  The paint has chipped off and now metal shows through.  Moisture comes out of top of the micro and has damaged my cabinet above.  I don't even use unless I have to until I can find another one to replace this one.
Spacers between door handle and door started coming apart after the first year.  Very poor quality, brittle plastic. I am guessing they were over tightened during assembly.  Can not buy just the spacer so have to buy the handle to go with it.... $80 part for the do it your-selfers.  Dam shame. Another American company to fall victim to poor quality.
Gues what 14 months after buying It happened to me  We will try Samsung To morrow If no help everthing called Samsung is going to the recycling bin
We had the prior model of GE Cafe Microwave, which completely died after 3months.  It was like pulling teeth to get GE to do anything about it, however they finally agreed to replace it if I paid for deliverer and installation. We went two months without a microwave.  This new replacement model isn't much better.  The fake metal over the plastic handle started peeling off after a week and the display dimmed. They did replace the handle, but they said they can't do anything about this display as its not covered.<br /><br />As for using the microwave, it is a pain. There is no keypad, so you have to dial in all of the time.  Sometimes you press the dial to select something, other times you press a button.  It is not intuitive at all and is very hard to use.  I can't wait for it to completely die so I can buy a different brand.
DO NOT BUY THIS!
I bought this unit to replace an older LG model that was discontinued.  The older model worked fine until I melted it with a small kitchen fire (naturally the one time I disconnected the smoke alarm).  The new model arrived quickly.  I got a friend to help install it.  You'll need a friend  -It's too heavy for you to hold it up with one hand while you screw the bolt on with the other.<br /><br />I gave it four stars in my initial review but I'm changing it to one star because after only a couple of months, the microwave's fan and interior lights would go on sometimes when I closed the oven door.  But if I opened and gently closed the door again, it'd turn off.  It's been about six months since I first installed this oven and this problem is becoming frequent.  Today, my son texts me from home that the microwave won't turn off no matter what he does so I told him to leave the door open and when I get home tonight, I will disconnect it so it doesn't burn the house down.  A microwave oven is supposed to make our lives more convenient,  not fill us with dread that it can start an electric fire.  Checking on the internet, it seems that this is not an uncommon problem.  It's probably not going to be covered by warranty.  And how do I get it to the manufacturer?  They aren't going to pay a repairman to make a housecall for a lousy microwave oven.  If I pay for shpping both ways, I might as well buy a new microwave.  Lessons learned:  I will buy appliances from a brick and mortar store whose return/service policy I understand and I will not use an over-the-range microwave again.
Died after a year, &#34;service may be needed, keyboard shorted&#34; message , was told the replacement part cost $165 for smart board but may also need a new keypad $150....never again with GE products....buyers beware !!!!
This microwave came with the house I purchased 6 months ago. Manufacture date is Nov 2013. It stopped working for no reason. No error message. Outlet still works. Samsung customer support has been terrible. This is not the first time I have a problem with samsung appliances. Only thing they seem to do right are TV's. I recommend buying a different microwave.
Bought this microwave in 2011 to replace a 30 year old Sharp Carousel that was given to us 20 years ago. The Sharp didn't heat evenly, but it lasted much longer than this one did. This GE microwave looks great and heats fast and evenly for the most part and I love the inverter defroster! But it is impossible to make good popcorn, no matter what settings I use it always ends up with lots of unpopped kernels and some of it burned. I wish the door closure was designed better. As with most modern day products, the plastic parts just don't hold up to everyday use. It currently only works if you slam the door hard. I have a feeling that its days are numbered and I won't be replacing it with another GE microwave!!
I have one of these guys in my kitchen and I hate it. It is mediocre in performance and louder than your average landscaper's leaf blower. Thanks, but no thanks!
I purchased a recently updated condo built in 1969.  All the kitchen appliances were purchased in 2012 and unfortunately all of them were Frigidaire.  Not even 3 months into living in the condo and the Microwave died.  All the keys of the control panel won't work.  I just called to get someone to look at it and they charge $80 just for an estimate.  A new microwave is $200.00 but after reading all these reviews, I will buy anything but Frigidaire. I never had any appliances from this brand before in any of my homes and now I know why.  Total waste of money.
First time I've purchased an appliance through Amazon. They delivered it on it's SIDE for some reason (I guess the arrow pointing up was confusing?) but it works nonetheless.
The unit burst into flames at the rear, right  shelf support, after 18 months of service.  I was warming a cup of coffee.<br />Stay safe and don't buy this item.
I love GE.  I'm an energy star freak.  Then tonight, 1.5 years after I've moved into my brand new house with brand new appliances, this microwave caught on fire while popping popcorn using the popcorn button.  The popcorn was fine... But the entire top of my microwave has melted into gross plastic blobs.  Thank god I was paying attention.
Better than what's available at Sears, works great, easy installation (I didn't like the black center as it doesn't match our kitchen, but for the price I'm living with it...)
Worked great for a year or so and now the door won't close properly so have to get a new one.  I expected better quality out of a microwave this expensive.
Purchased our Samsung OTR SMH1816 microwave in 2012. Worked well for about 24 months. More than 1 problem with this particular model. From the beginning the light continually &#34;blew&#34;. Used the proper watt microwave bulb and even used a lesser watt microwave bulb.  Only 1 time able to &#34;unscrew&#34; the bulb. Always broke from the base.  Had to turn power off each time changing it for safety.  About 6 months ago began making strange noises and then started to &#34;over cook&#34; items.  Burned popcorn.  Got hotter than usual.  I kept an eye on it for those &#34;now and then&#34; burning problems.  3 days ago I opened the door to put something in it and it came on! Scary and dangerous!!!  Closed the door quickly.  Opened again and it started again.  Pushed the STOP button...kept running!  Closed the door and it stopped!  This happened several times. Sometimes it started with door opened and sometimes not.  We had no recourse but to purchase another microwave. Very disappointed in this product.  We have been fans of Samsung electronics but now wonder if Samsung deserves our positive response.
This microwave has broken twice in the past two years. First was a transformer that I replaced. Now the item sparks like crazy. Would not recommend.
Terrible. Had for 2 years and the curcuit board went. Causes power surges. Need to replace instead of repair.
Obviously I had not read reviews of this microwave or I would never have purchased.  Installed this microwave in a second home that we visited about every two months or so for a week or two.  This microwave was not used very much until we moved permanently 3 months ago.  Oven started making strange noises about two weeks ago.  Noises have now intensified so I called LG.  Their respond was you're out of warranty but we think the turntable might be your problem.  We''ll send you over to parts where you can purchase that part.  Honestly never had a microwave problem with a turntable even in the cheapest tabletop models.  As far as I'm concerned LG does not care about their customers and instead of telling me I need to purchase that part, which might not even be the problem, they should have just sent me the part free of charge.  Home Depot is going to work with me on this since I purchased appliance from them.  I was not aware there had been a fire issue and will now be watching and careful.  I also agree with other reviewers that this appliance is extremely loud.  And lastly, this is my first and last LG product.  I had also purchased an LG side by side refrigerator which I hate but it works... so have to continue using.
Steel case was damaged on back side.  Was able to us because it was hidden when installed under cabinet.  The only complaint about the unit itself is the stainless steel interior gets scotched from the glass turntable plate unless you rare VERY careful.  The microwave/oven features are great.  Very easy to use and looks great!
Lasted 2 years and then fell apart. The tabs that hold the window in place all broke off on their own. LG does not care since it is out of warranty. They want to charge me over $100 for a new door.
works very well
WOW am I ever surprised! The product descriptions states &#34;Spacious 2.0 cu. ft. interior Accommodates a wide range of meal and snack items&#34; this spacious interior is in reality 1.4 cubic feet!!!. LG's claim of 2 cubic feet include all of the little indentations on the sides and bottom So perhaps this unit has a 2 cubic feet capacity .. if you laid it on it's back drilled a hole in the door and poured in 2 cubic feet of liquid! Well so much for honesty in advertising ... I'll write another review when i actually start using my small microwave but for now I feel duped.
Had it installed for a few weeks now and works fine. It's a microwave. You plug it in. Fan speeds are great. First time ordering an appliance online and so far very happy.
perfect for my application
UPDATE, DECEMBER 2015: I posted this review in January. The microwave stopped working altogether in June 2015. If you find this model anywhere online I advise you DO NOT BUY IT....<br /><br />Full disclosure - I usually make my purchases from Amazon but I had a coupon for 15% off any item at PC Richards (a local store) and was fooled into buying this when it was recommended to me by a salesman. I've owned it for just over 2 years now. Most problems started immediately. I will never buy another GE microwave for this reason, and I'm considering never buying any GE product - anything that takes electricity to run must be made much better for safety reasons, and this is one of the worse electronic appliances I've ever purchased.<br /><br />PROS: none that I know of. No wonder it's discontinued.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />&#62; Very soon after the warranty ended we started smelling burnt plastic whenever it was used for any length of time, at any power level. The smell lingers and gets into your food.<br /><br />&#62; When cooking anything, a baked potato for example, the moisture from the food gets trapped inside the oven an pours out when you open the door. The walls, floor, and ceiling of the microwave are dripping wet and must be dried after each use unless you want to end up with a muggy mungy moldy mess after a few weeks. And no, the vent is not blocked on the outside. On the inside, maybe, but that would be a defect the consumer cannot see or fix.<br /><br />&#62; Door open button is very flimsy.<br /><br />&#62; Light stays on when you close the door (when you're done) if you are not careful. You must make sure door closes completely - even if it looks closed it might not be and if the lights are on in the kitchen you might not notice the interior light of the microwave is still on - this can make it over heat (I came back hours later and the inside of the oven was very warm) and may blow out the bulb, which normally lasts the lifetime of the oven.<br /><br />&#62; Vents are on the left side, not the top or bottom. This means venting can be difficult if you have something sitting next to it on the left side. See my photo.<br /><br />&#62; All buttons are hard to push, which is not good for those with disability or arthritis.<br /><br />&#62; The clock timer (the one used when not cooking) is tricky to stop - you must read the manual to figure it out because you can't use common sense for this one; manual says you must press timer button and hold for at least 3 seconds to stop this timer.<br /><br />&#62; If you make a mistake when using the cooking timer you can easily add more time to cooking than you planned. For example, I pressed 14 minutes but wanted to change it to 12, so I tried to clear it and thought I did, but when the 12 minutes of cooking time was done it started again on its own for another 14 minutes. There was nothing to warn me this would happen and I could find nothing in the manual that explains it.<br /><br />&#62; No minute button, only 30 second increments.<br /><br />&#62; Turntable moves out of place very easily, like when you place an item on it or remove something from inside the microwave. The groves that hold it in place are shallow so this allows it to move out of place with just a small nudge. Very annoying.<br /><br />&#62; Emails to GE were never answered.62; Vents are on the left side, not the top or bottom. This means venting can be difficult if you have something sitting next to it on the left side. See my photo.<br /><br />&#62; All buttons are hard to push, which is not good for those with disability or arthritis.<br /><br />&#62; The clock timer (the one used when not cooking) is tricky to stop - you must read the manual to figure it out because you can't use common sense for this one; manual says you must press timer button and hold for at least 3 seconds to stop this timer.<br /><br />&#62; If you make a mistake when using the cooking timer you can easily add more time to cooking than you planned. For example, I pressed 14 minutes but wanted to change it to 12, so I tried to clear it and thought I did, but when the 12 minutes of cooking time was done it started again on its own for another 14 minutes. There was nothing to warn me this would happen and I could find nothing in the manual that explains it.<br /><br />&#62; No minute button, only 30 second increments.<br /><br />&#62; Turntable moves out of place very easily, like when you place an item on it or remove something from inside the microwave. The groves that hold it in place are shallow so this allows it to move out of place with just a small nudge. Very annoying.<br /><br />&#62; Emails to GE were never answered.
Great item. Works well.
great suction not noisy
wish I had read reviews on the GE microwaves before purchasing one..Totally fried after only 2 years..Stay away from over the range GE microwaves..Junk
The handle is attached to the door by two weak screws that bear up against a nonmetallic surface on the door. For my unit, the lower attachment door surface broke within six months and the handle pulled away from the door.<br />I am having a service call take care of it but it looks like a design flaw. Even if I get a replacement door, I expect it will break again in six months. Avoid this model design.<br />Updated Dec 2016: Yes the replacement door also is showing the same problem.<br />Worse: The magnetron failed as soon as the one year warranty was up. Would not heat food. We had a service call and replaced it.<br />It has failed again in 9 months. LG wants more for a service call than the new microwave cost.<br />I would avoid LG microwaves completely. I still have a countertop Panasonic microwave working perfectly after 15 years - unfortunately LG does not know microwaves :)
Warning: Stay away from this microwave.  It looks pretty, but it will cost you.  Read the other reviews about its unreliability, GE's poor service, and the expense of repairing this product.  I should have done that before we purchased ours.  If your product is still under the one-year warranty, maybe you have a shot at breaking even.  Ours stopped working just a few months after the 12-month warranty expired.  If you're not under warranty, this is an appliance nightmare, which begins with a $99 service charge so the GE authorized repairman can tell you how much it will actually cost you to repair the microwave (parts and labor).  Not sure how you can ever cost-justify repairing one of these.  Update: GE told us it was not cost effective to repair the unit, but they did offer a $200 rebate toward another GE microwave.  Still can't recommend the unit.
One of the worst appliances I ever bought.  And customer support on an issue with it was horrendous, and then non-existent.  I recommend anyone considering this unit to finish off their kitchen matched set of other Samsung products forgo aesthetics and get something else.  First, as others have stated, the control panel is awful.  It it hard to read and the buttons are set in such a way (presumable to keep someone from pushing a button unintended with cleaning the panel) that you have to press very hard in exactly the right spot.  No feel and go with this unit.  The food, in spite of the revolving turntable, does not heat evenly. The stainless steel for some odd reason is difficult to clean (exterior).  We have had other stainless steel appliances from other companies that cleaned easily. Then,  a short time after warranty expired, the unit failed to work.  It turns out some of the factory work was not done well on the circuit board and a loose connection caused a short and burned out the primary &#34;microwave&#34; unit.  The dealer told us it was out of warranty, so we had it repaired, then one of their repair people said it was a defect, not a warranty issue and I should contact Samsung.  They used every excuse in the book, and finally said something along the lines of &#34;policy does not allow us to ever pay out of pocket expense, regardless of the cause or situation&#34;.  End of story, end of Samsung.  Later, a salesperson told me they have had numerous complaints about the unit.  Samsung TV's are great.  But I will never own another one of their cheaply manufactured appliances!
After two years, the microwave died yesterday involved in black smoke. Luckily we were able to manage  the mess before the whole house burned down. Stay away from this company.
Great buy
We've had it and used it for over two years now (Sep '12 to present) and it has worked fine the whole time.  We don't slam the door or pull down on it and it seems to be holding up fine.  We use it two to three times a day.<br /><br />Like another reviewer said, you cannot cook while the timer is running.
CVM1790SSSS replaced our old CafÃ© series microwave AT NO COST (within 5 years of purchase) as part of GE's &#34;Touchpad Replacement Program&#34;...(Kudos to GE for doing the right thing for that):<br /><br />Pro's:<br />-Touchpad completely redesigned (obviously less heat sensitive).<br />-Inside is stainless vs. enamel like the old one.  That is an obvious upgrade - for sure.<br />-The goofy tilt open top bar of the old unit is replaced with a fixed plate and top vents.<br />-Shortcut buttons are more useful for us vs. the old set-up.<br /><br />Con's (would have given a 5 Star except for):<br />-Control panel redesign includes a dial.  It is very easy to use, so only a con for being less attractive.<br />-Handle is plastic covered with metal looking coating vs. real metal like the old unit.  It seems very stout and the GE rep said the peeling was addressed this year, so we are hoping for the best.<br />-Emblem is now black vs. the original red like all the other pieces in the CafÃ© set (easy fix - below).<br /><br />*We talked the installers into letting us keep the old emblem - The red emblem is held on by just 1 screw (easily removed).  The red emblem cap (metal) was easily separated from the mount plug with a knife and affixed on-top of the new/black emblem with some gentle adhesive...an easy fix and no damage to the black emblem or stainless fascia.
I have a Frigidaire microwave model CFMV 164LS, a former version of this model installed in my RV.  It quit working after 3 months of use.  After weeks of trying to get it replaced under warranty, Frigidaire has finally found someone to do the replacement with this model but Frigidaire has now refused to pay the service fee for doing the replacement where the unit is located.
Damn good clock but not a valid microwave. Magnatron fried just like the other reviews. Whirlpool should be called Swirlpool because you are sending money down the drain when you purchase their products.
This microwave was purchased in 9/2013.  As of 11/2014 the unit no longer heats food and needs to be replaced.  We bought a Samsung dishwasher at the same time and it gives us trouble also.  I will never buy another Samsung product.
I just went on the internet to see if anybody had this model in stock, and prices available. We bought this model 2 yrs ago when we re-did our kitchen. Ours also went bad after only light use. Mostly reheating items.  The service tech said he couldn't believe a Whirlpool product would fail like that. The shield by the magnetron had a hole burned through it and was allowing the microwaves to escape, thus shutting the unit off after just a couple seconds. Seems like a dangerous situation to me. I wonder how Whirlpool feels about this? Far less than satisfied.  Will avoid Whirlpool products in the future. Less than 1 star review.
Great item !!!!
I bought this microwave at a deep discount from a friend who was going through a split.  It was almost new and I was able to remove and install it myself.  Despite a cracked plastic part on the front door (prior owner said this happened within the first month), this microwave lasted about 2 or 3 years before having some erratic heating issues;  at full power, sometimes the food coming out was as cold as when I put it in.  I got around this by selecting 90% cooking power.  This worked for another year or so before eventually having erratic cooking no matter what I did.  Last week the microwave shutdown within the first 10 seconds of heating.  Unplug and plug the unit would reset it, but same issue if I tried cooking.  Later that day, tried cooking again, this time the timer would run but no cooking (and the usual fan noise didn't start either).<br /><br />This $1000 Whirlpool Easy-bake has clearly cooked itself.  A microwave at this price SHOULD be bulletproof.  Clearly it is not. Based upon other reviews here, Whirlpool suckered us Velos owners into subsidizing their purchase of the other GOOD brands.<br /><br />Ironic that I need to buy a Haier microwave just to get a decent quality microwave (ie non-Whirlpool family brands)
Whirlpool &#34;GOLD&#34;. I thought I was getting the &#34;best&#34; kitchen appliances...NOT!!!  I have to press the Clear button after every cycle to reset it. I also have to wait about 1-2 minutes, after every cycle, with the door open, for the light to come back on (or it will not reset). Because it has been just over 1 year since purchase, whirlpool will do nothing for me other than refer me to one of their overpriced repair people.  Never again whirlpool...
This is built to break.  I have a 5 yr warranty from the dealer, which is fortunate because I am now on my third repair or replace process in 18 months.  For me it has consistently been the essential part of the microwave-the magnetron-which makes it heat!  update Oct 2015:  I bought this in Feb 2013 and the magnetron issue has happened once again, and I don't even use it a lot for actual cooking.   I can get it repaired or replaced because of the warranty, but it is tiresome to go through this so frequently.   The GE model I purchased previously lasted 12 years.  Has a commitment to quality dropped so drastically?  And Bosch is alleged to be one of the better brands.     Buyer Beware!
We bought this microwave less than a year ago and it has stopped working.  This is the second microwave we've had to replace in less than three years the previous microwave (high end /professional grade) lasted two years.  Standards of manufacturing and repair costs have made microwaves &#34;disposable&#34; appliances.
Although I bought an older model (SMH9187ST), I'm adding a review here because of the SE error plague w/ Samsung microwaves in general.  I'm amazed that Samsung continued with the same faulty design model after model ... and it says something that when I called Samsung, they said the SE error was under warranty for my unit which was manufactured 5 years ago.<br /><br />They set up a repair for two weeks from now, but if it happens again I won't go through another repair, even free, will just replace with a non-Samsung microwave.  The only reason I got 5 years out of it is that I split my time between two residences, and actual live-in usage at this home has been only about 2.5 years.
Excellent product. I recommend it
Had unit professionally installed 2 year ago but it has a habit of turning itself on. Had been doing that and latest episode is using it and it wouldn't go off. Have to unplug it after every use until latest episode. This unit is unsafe and dangerous.--- JVM1540DMWW. Stay away from it!!!
The item was fine. The price was great too compared other sellers.
Mine caught on fire.  The inner top service cover that is made out of plastic caught on fire.
Full disclosure, owned the previous model PSA1201RSS for two years. This model has a TSB out for peeling door handles (as one other reviewer wrote). However, their review is not for this improved model. If you have an Advantium oven with the peeling door handle don't just order the handle - replace the whole door. It is a new handle design that addresses the problem. My door was replaced under warranty.<br /><br />Bought a new house, miss our oven so much we're having one installed here. If you're considering one remember this:<br /><br />1) You cannot run it as a microwave with the metal tray and/or racks in - it will dramatically shorten its life<br />2) You cannot run it as an oven without the metal tray at least in - it will dramatically shorten its life.<br />3) You cannot soak the control panel down with soapy water to clean it - you can short it out. You clean it simply by wiping with a microfiber cloth. Done.<br /><br />All three of these points are in the owner's manual - which I'm going to speculate a lot of people don't read. When I sold my last house I purposely put the owner's manual around all the racks outside of the oven and wrote a note to the new owner, &#34;do not use until you read.&#34;<br /><br />OK - rant over - here is the goods.<br /><br />This does almost everything. My fiance and I have used ours for:<br /><br />We have used it for proofing dough, as a warming oven, and we have used it for baking and cooking as a convection oven.

It combines the microwave and halogen oven at the same time. Because the microwave is used at reduced power, you can use the metal tray (not the racks) for speed cook mode.<br /><br />You can bake two large potatoes, crispy skin on the outside (cooking trick, brush with olive oil for crispy skin and sprinkle with Kosher salt on the outside) in 13 minutes. They are fluffy inside, not microwaved &#34;streamed&#34; tasting.<br /><br />You can cook (reheat) frozen foods in 1/3 to 1/2 the time on the package. So frozen taquitos can be booked in 9 minutes instead of 27. You can bake crescent rolls in the can in about 1/2 the time you would in a conventional oven, crispy outside, flaky inside.<br /><br />There are hundreds of pre-programmed cook settings for a wide range of food items and dishes. Whether you're using it as a simple microwave to cook bacon, or you're using the speed cook function to roast meat. Yes, you can even roast in it.<br /><br />The capacity for a microwave is huge, at 1.7 cubic feet, and if you're a family of 2 or 3, you'll probably find yourself using this for most of your baking needs. I rarely used our oven.<br /><br />So what can't it do?<br /><br />Certain food types won't bake well using speed cook or the convection halogen cooking - that is why I say it isn't a perfect stand in for a second oven if you want 100% versatility. It can't broil (the 240 Volt version apparently can). In addition we have found certain vegetables, like whole spaghetti squash, or a whole roasted cauliflower, won't cook properly in the oven. The insides never seem to heat up when used strictly as a conventional convection oven. As a microwave or speed cook no problem.<br /><br />We found this to be a huge time saver - and we just bought this unit for installation in our home.<br /><br />Oh, and on the peeling handles - again that was the previous model.

Bought th microwave about 24 months ago and it died last night.  No error but smell of electrical material was evident.  I was fearfully of a fire breaking out.  We unplugged it and called samsung.  They instructed us in troubleshooting but to no avail.  I then started to read reviews and now I plan to replace with another brand because this is a dangerous<br />Appliance.  Definitely not worth repairing for both financial and safety reasons.  I advise not yo buy samsung this appliance should have been recalled
This microwave cooks well and looks ok.....  The problem is the stupid beeper that won't quit beeping until you open the door!! There isn't a way to turn this annoying feature off either.  If you want peace and quiet look elsewhere.  But, if you like high pitch annoying sounds this is the microwave for you.
Looked large in the box, but fits nicely over the range.  Looks great and works great.  Has met all expectations and for a lot less than other microwaves for more.
We have had this microwave for about 6 years now, the Light button has just stopped working but everything else works on it still.<br /><br />Pro:After reading the manual we were able to type in a button combo that mutes the annoying BEEP. This was a nice feature to add in. It cooks fine and we are happy with it.<br /><br />Con: Minor inconvenience, when cooking popcorn (about 3 bags of it one after another) there is a thermal cutoff sensor that shuts the microwave off if it gets too hot, this is easily solved by just letting the microwave cool off or cooking bags of popcorn on a plate.<br /><br />This microwave is extremely cheap and if we have to (because it would cost more to replace the control panel/light button than it would to replace the whole thing) we would probably buy it again.
In all seriousness... shame on you GE.<br />I purchased this microwave a little more than a year ago. And of course it is now out of warrantee. And thus falling apart... LITERALLY!<br />The &#34;metal&#34; handle is not actually metal, it is cheap plastic with metallic-looking tape on it. And the tape is peeling off. When i called GE they said &#34;it's probably due to the heat from the stove below.&#34; I told them, &#34;It's an over-the-range microwave!!! It should not fall apart because of heat.&#34; To which they replied, &#34;Sorry. New handle is $100 bucks plus another $100 for someone to come out and install it.&#34;<br />I wish I could post a picture of the defective part here but the site doesn't allow me.<br />After a lifetime of thinking GE was the go-to brand for good quality products... this microwave will be the last GE appliance i ever buy.
Don't buy this microwave. I had the board fail in two weeks. Got it replaced. This microwave is extremely loud. LG supposed to be a good brand product that I knew, The turntable stopped working just after one year after the warranty expired. It will cost more to repair than buy new. Sucks!! I will go for a different brand.
Appliance was the right one to match my other appliances but did not work on power up. There is not a service tech that is backed by the company seller. So it had to be sent back. My money was refunded pronto but I would rather have the applince
We purchased our oven in December 2011. No problems until recently when we tried to start the oven it would show &#34;pause&#34; on the display and not come on at all. Now it just comes on if the door is closed and nothing has been entered on the key pad. Short lived junk as far as I am concerned. My last microwave lasted 5 times as long and was still working when I gave it away to go to this over the oven unit. Quality is long gone.
Ugh the headaches.  Purchased 4 years ago and everyone seems to be having the same problems.  Mine was WONDERFUL while it worked.  then after 2 years the dreaded beeping, touchpad operating by itself, started happening.  Luckily I purchased the 5 year warranty.  So out came the repair man...after much hemming and hawing, the door/electronics needed replacement.  $550.00 and it worked again.  Fast forward to 2014, guess what? Yep same problem starts again.  Touchpad not working, beeping, self activating all over again.  So again trusty warranty comes in handy...out comes another repair man...yep hemming and hawing....another $550.00 for new door with electronics.  This time the warranty company calls me...complaining they  just repaired 2 years ago...I explained these are happening to Velos units all over the internet.  They agreed to repair one more time..or refund my purchase price!  Ill have think on it..  Buyer beware
This microwave was new to my home when I moved in. After 18 months, the door switch broke: Which meant that any time the door was shut, the microwave spontaneously turned itself on (and didn't turn off until the door was opened). Fortunately, this occurred while we were home -- otherwise the microwave might have started a huge fire from continuously running empty! Because  it was out of warranty, Frigidaire customer service was ridiculously unhelpful; the representative told me that I would have to pay $150.00 just to send someone out to confirm what the problem was, and then pay for additional parts and labor to fix it! Instead I ditched the piece of garbage and bought a Samsung. I would NEVER buy a Frigidaire product again. P.S. I also had a similar experience with my two year-old Frigidaire gas range, where the glass oven door spontaneously shattered while sitting idle. Run fast and far from Frigidaire.
This was rated fairly high by Consumer Reports, and usage over the past month or so has borne that out. It is roomy and it cooks fairly evenly and quickly. The basic controls are fairly intuitive, though apparently I have to set the power level before I set the cook time, rather than the other way around the way it was on my previous microwave. The special features, like the warm up with sensors that shuts off when the food starts to steam, are things that I don't seem to be able to get the hang of. After playing with the inverter defrost button and keypad, I was able to start using that in the cooking of certain frozen convenience items. I don't like the push button opener; I think that is what will break first, and then I won't be able to open the door. I do not regret the purchase so far. If the machine lasts ten years like the prior microwave it will have been a great purchase.
Received with damages in the back and on the sides. Contacted seller with no response. I needed a microwave so I didn't return the item. It is overpriced, but I was desperate because my old microwave stopped working. I gave it 3 stars because I think this is a refurbished item that shouldn't be claimed as new. Also, the handle is made of plastic, not stainless steel as it appears to be. The Tape (made to look like stainless steel), keeps peeling from the heat of the range, and exposing the plastic more everyday. I have had this microwave for 8 months now, and half of the tape wrapped around the plastic handle is gone. It is functional, but looks really tacky.
Arrived full of dents and broken exhaust mount. Had to have GE Repair come over and send a replacement.  Seller should have replaced unit but GE made it work out.  Oven seems like it will be okay but GE does have their problems.  Let's see if this one lasts longer than 3 years, the GE oven I replaced did not.
I purchased this model in stainless steel three years ago. Problems I found with it were mostly concerning the sensor cooking being completely inaccurate. Some items cooked or were warmed too little and some were much too hot. It was easier to simply time it myself.    But the straw that broke the camel's back for me on this unit was how long it lasted. It simply quit heating last week after being 35 months old. Everything else works but nothing gets warmed or cooked, leading me to believe the magnetron went bad. The microwave comes with a one year parts and labor warranty and a ten year parts only warranty on the magnetron. In speaking to an authorized repair center for Samsung, I was told I would pay a $99 trip charge to determine what is wrong, and if it is the magnetron, an order would be placed with Samsung for the part which will take three to six weeks to arrive and then I would have to pay another trip charge and labor to R & R the magnetron. Bottom line - even with the magnetron warranty, it will cost me more than I paid for the microwave to repair it.    I have had several microwaves since 1978 when they became popular. I have never had one that lasted less than 10 years. When this one went bad last week, I pulled out a countertop model Sharp Carousel that I bought 15 years ago and am using it, still working perfectly. I went to Lowe's where I purchased the unit and told the salesman that I went all Samsung three years ago while remodeling my kitchen and am now worried about the other units, particularly the refrigerator because it is making noise that it shouldn't. He told me that he has had more complaints about Samsung microwaves than any other brand and any other kind of appliance, and the only kind of appliance that Samsung has not had numerous complaints on is their ranges.    I have had serious issues with Samsung's customer service in the past due to owning many of their electronics. If you read any reviews about their service after the sale, you will find it is virtually nonexistent. But I wrote an email to Samsung letting them know that in my opinion, a microwave should last longer than three years and am very disappointed with the product. Naturally, I have not received a response of any kind.    I strongly suggest anyone considering buying a Samsung microwave to look elsewhere. They are not built to last and getting service after the sale from them is impossible.
I bought this microwave less than a year ago.  Worked fine for reheating and defrosting items, but being a 700 watt microwave, it did take longer to do those things.  One day, after ~8 months of use, I placed a cup of coffee to reheat, and it failed to work; power on, lights working, but no luck.  Don't waste your money or time.
Purchased as a replacement for one that had been destroyed by a tenant who microwaved a plastic cup.  The first one was a nice model.  This one has served well, as well.
Perfect
This may or may not be a solution for you but it worked for me.<br />My SMH8165ST was purchased in January of 2012. In March of 2014 it started having the SE errors and similar to others on this site, would start on its own, night light would go off and on on its own, beep every 15 minutes, etc.<br />I tried all of the YouTube and other suggestions with removing the circuit board, cleaning all the connections. Originally this worked for two weeks, and then the problems restarted. Kept on repeating the process for the next 2 Â½ months with the time interval getting shorter and shorter between cleanings.<br />The last time I left the power on when reinstalling the panel and the system worked fine. Oops, forgot to reinstall the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />Reinstalled the panel with the mounting bracket, again with live power and the SE error came on instantly.<br />Repeated the process three times, no errors without the circuit board mounting bracket; SE errors with the Circuit board mounting bracket.<br />With a large magnifying glass, I discovered a very, very small scratch on the ribbon cable between the circuit board and the control panel. This scratch lines up with a very sharp edge on the circuit board mounting bracket and it seemed that through vibration and general use; the ribbon cable was starting the have a direct contact between the embedded wires in the ribbon cable and the sharp edge of the mounting bracket, more than likely causing the strange SE errors.<br />I covered the sharp edge on the mounting bracket with electricianâ€™s tape, as well as the ribbon cable where it bent around the mounting bracket projection.<br />Then while reinstalling the panel with live power, I tried twisting the panel, hitting it against the edge of the microwave, jiggling all the wires and all sorts of moves to see if the SE error would show up. No errors showed up.<br />The microwave has been working perfectly for two months now. It my case it is most likely that the manufacturing process was at fault for installing the ribbon cable tight against a sharp edge of the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />I would give this microwave 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor quality control during manufacturing.e manufacturing process was at fault for installing the ribbon cable tight against a sharp edge of the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />I would give this microwave 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor quality control during manufacturing.
The door near the bottom handle mount suddenly cracked, causing the handle to fall off, and the front glass panel to slide down. Wow, this is the first time I've seen a microwave oven break like this, especially an expensive high end unit like this one! It appears to be a design flaw: The door hook springs feel unusually strong, resulting in some unnecessary stress on the door when closing. Still, this seems like a really silly thing for a high-end microwave oven.<br /><br />I recommend you avoid this.
I am only adding my review so that I can lower the star count on this piece of garbage. I have no new information to add that has not already been thoroughly covered by the other reviewers. I also have the SE error and my microwave that just recently went out of warranty is now useless. DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG MICROWAVE OVENS...!!!
I wanted to replace our GE SpaceMaker over-the-range 30 microwave and found this model that matched well.  (We actually have the black version, but it is otherwise identical.)  The Samsung obviously shares the same basic design as the GE with a redesigned front panel.  I knew and trusted the Samsung brand from our personal electronics (such as several smartphones), so picked one of these up on sale at a local retailer.  Unfortunately, what I got was a bare-bones minimal redesign with major flaws.  It's like they took the basic GE design, made it super cheap, and replaced the panel with a terrible non-intuitive redesign.<br /><br />Installation was easy - I was even able to use the original rear mounting plate as the Samsung was, indeed, a twin of the GE series.  This microwave fit perfectly into our 30 wide opening with very minimal gaps on each side.  I had to drill new holes through the cabinet above, however, as the top was slightly different.  The height is 16 for the main cabinet, 16 5/8 to the very bottom of the light box underneath (not shown in the picture, but it's there).  I plugged it in and quickly realized that this sure isn't the same quality as the GE was.<br /><br />The first and most annoying thing is the user interface on the front panel.  The buttons are hard to interpret, and things that are easy on the GE are now impossible or very confusing.  Heating a beverage is common, right?  No beverage button on this unit - you need to discover the button to press is COOK, and then wait for the slowly scrolling text to confirm you are correct and need to press 1 next.<br /><br />What about canned vegetables?  There's a VEGGIES button, so this should be easy.  Not so!  Press the button, and across scrolls: SELECT ... (pause) ... 1 FOR ... (pause) ... FRESH ... (pause again) ... VEGGIES ... (um, I know it's vegetables, I just pressed the button!) ... 2 FOR ... (yet ANOTHER pause) ... FROZEN ... (darn, guess it must be 3) ... VEGGIES ... clear ... SELECT ... (oh no! where can frozen veggies be?!) ... etc.  At least the SELECT doesn't scroll when it appears, only when it's scrolling away.  But the worst part is seeing the VEGGIES on the display, alone, as I wait, knowing full well I pressed the veggies button.<br /><br />And I still have trouble figuring out which button is for the fan and which is for the light.  Making it worse is that there is one button for the light (HI/LO/OFF) and 2 buttons for the fan (ON/OFF and 4 speed).  Actually, there is another button each for some obscure settings we never use.  Sure, there are some tiny dark grey letters showing which set of button is which, but those are only visible up close in bright light.<br /><br />Gone are the easy 1-button 1 to 6 minute quick start buttons.  Now it takes 4 button presses to do the same thing, although at least there is still a button to add 30 seconds.  I could go on and on about the poor interface, but I think you get the idea.<br /><br />Next major issue: the stovetop light is way dimmer than the GE was.  Even though there are 2 places in the design for bulbs, and my GE had 2 halogen bulbs, this one has a SINGLE incandescent bulb - not bright at ALL.  This is huge, as we use our stovetop frequently and now it is always poorly lit.<br /><br />And a another biggie: when the timer finishes, it gives 4 short, quiet beeps, and stops.  No repeat, nothing more.  So unless you are right by it, it is pretty much worthless.  We can now only use our oven timer - so no more dual timers when we are cooking different things.  I can't even count how many things have overcooked or been ruined because of the lame timer.<br /><br />The look is also unattractive.  The lightbox hangs down below the lower front plastic panel, ensuring everyone knows how tacky this microwave is.  Even the display is an ugly old-fashioned blue 14-segment per digit 7-digit display.  Most calculators have better!  Actually, I kind of like the blue.  Everything else in my kitchen is amber, so it creates a nice contrast.<br /><br />Furthermore, it is noisy.  It frequently makes weird grinding-like noises from the bottom right (I think it is a fan or the microwave element) - if I tap it there it usually diminishes or goes away for a while.<br /><br />Finally, the front glass broke once when we were opening the door a couple of months after getting it.  Samsung did send out a repairman within 2 weeks and repaired it under warranty and it hasn't happened again in the many months since.<br /><br />Is there anything I like about this microwave?  Well, it works.  It has a turntable.  It has sensor cooking.  And it has dual grease-filters on either side of the bottom with a powerful exhaust fan (that has 4 levels when not using the microwave, 2 when in use).  It also has an easy-to-clean all-white interior.  And it was less expensive (on sale) than the similar GE units - but rightly so.<br /><br />PROS<br />It works.<br />Sensor cooking.<br />Dual grease filters.<br />Easily fits space replacing similar GE models.<br /><br />CONS<br />Horrible user interface.<br />Poor single-bulb incandescent stovetop lighting.<br />Loud, obnoxious noises.<br />Cheap looking.<br />Worthless kitchen timer.s amber, so it creates a nice contrast.<br /><br />Furthermore, it is noisy.

very nice
Add me to the list of the great disgruntled.  Ours stopped working after a year and 4 months. It heats food, but the turntable doesn't spin and you can't change  anything on the touch screen.  Stick the food in and it just hums. A fire waiting to happen.<br /><br />Wish I would have read reviews here before I bought it.  It was the pretty one the wife loved lol. People are being honest about this lemon.  I did buy a square trade warranty after reading these reviews. Lucky and square trade is being good about it.
love the microvave,especially the prompts which makes initial usage inherently friendly and easy to navigate.heats well-we're very satisfied with it.
Very well made and easy to install, Great shipping on this bulky item.
Never, ever buy an LG microwave! Three years ago, I splurged and spent $800 on a microwave/convection oven combo. I trusted that it was a quality product and that would last -- wrong on both counts. In less than three years, the control panel failed and the repair was a control panel replacement at $670 which could only be made by a LG approved repair shop. LG customer service offered anything but service. They were surly, unhelpful, and they inflict THE most obnoxious and repetitious ad on lengthy hold victims (23 minutes). It now costs $350 to buy a new, non-LG microwave installed, so I'm reluctantly sending their shoddy product to the landfill. LG doesn't stand behind their product, they are not built to last, and I will never buy any of their products again. I hope you don't fall into the same, expensive trap that I did.
With a 1 year warranty this microwave lasted, of course, 13 months. Used to trust GE, but I'll be looking elsewhere for a new microwave and everything else for that matter. Problem is I read the bad reviews before I purchased it but figured it would at least last a couple of years, but instead just 1 month past the warranty period. Strongly suggest you do not purchase at least this model, think I'll try another company myself.
2 days after we had it installed it stopped heating food. During first service call we were told to unplug it and to let it reset. It still wasn't working. In the second service call we were instructed to turn the vent fan on manually when using the range top due to the microwave shutting down to avoid over-heating.  We immediately noticed that from that point on the microwave would not heat food unless the vent fan was running. (even if the stove was off and cold)  After the next service call, the microwave still wasn't heating food without the vent fan running despite the technician replacing a part and the microwave vibrating and humming whenever the vent fan was on after his repair.  We scheduled another service call.  The technician did not visit, stating that he had ordered a part that would solve the problem.  That was on May 15, 2014... it is now June 17th and we still don't have a working microwave. Disappointing for a $400 investment.<br /><br />Why:<br />I've ALWAYS recommended Samsung televisions and blue-ray players because they were excellent products with great features and no problems since 2009. The microwave I bought never worked properly and after 5 months and several service calls, it still does not work.  I'm afraid to spend any significant amount of money on a Samsung product if this is how defective merchandise is handled.<br /><br />UPDATE: October 25, 2014<br />After 7 months, countless hours on the phone with Samsung's customer service and about 7 to 9 service calls... we went back to Lowe's Home Improvement (we should have in the first place) and they IMMEDIATELY replaced it with a Whirlpool.<br /><br />I liked my Samsung Flat-screen TV so much that I was going replace my other 2 TVs with Samsungs. Their exceedingly poor service and support make it an absolute certainty that I will not buy a big-ticket item from them. On the off chance that you get a defective item, they will not make it right for you.
Let me add to the list of unhappy customers. We have had this microwave for about 4 years. It first failed within the first year and was replaced by the manufacturer without any issues. They came to the house and installed a replacement. Earlier this year some of the buttons on the control panel ceased to operate. I obtained a replacement panel and it worked OK for another month. Then, it ceased to heat anything. I replaced a defective diode and it ran OK for a few more months. Then yesterday while it was running I heard a poof and it shut down (probably blew the internal fuse). It also emitted an odor of something electrical overheating.<br />This time I'm throwing in the towel and will not attempt a repair. The ID label indicates that it was manufactured June 2010. I would expect to get more than 4 years out of such an appliance.<br />When it worked to did an OK job, but no better than the $50 counter top unit I keep on hand for when the main unit fails.<br />This time around I've ordered an LG and hope for better service.
My wife called them and asked if they had a little time bomb inside.  How else could the thing die right on time.  The oven made the sound of shorting electricity, gave off a few whiffs of ozone, and that was it.  The young girl at the other end of the call said that they may be able to look into getting us a new part, but we would have to pay for labor.  I'm not going to throw good money after bad.  I'm just not going to buy Frigidaire items anymore.<br /><br />We have purchased the Gallery Stove and Oven (which we absolutely love) and then we purchased the Gallery Microwave (which died), and we purchased the Gallery Dishwasher (which doesn't wash dishes).  We also have a Frigidaire Furnace (that cracks me up every time), which works great.
My microwave failed within 6 months of purchase.  It was fixed by a repair agency, who also told me that 'it is normal for them to completely fail and shut down.'  After the repair, it lasted only 2 months, before completely failing again.<br />Worst of all is Samsungs' customer service.  I couldn't imagine anything worse.  They (Samsung) have told me more times than I have fingers and toes, that they would call me back to make an appointment for service, but, after 3 weeks, I am still waiting for someone to call.  When I call in to Samsung, I am starting over each time (from scratch) even though they've given me a case number.  I'm tired of being told by their Indian representatives: &#34;I'm sorry for that!&#34;<br />Don't buy anything Samsung.
Oh my goodness, I can't believe how horrible this microwave is. All this material used to construct something that is just going to clog up the landfill.<br /><br />Here's our story.  Back in April of this year (2014) our old microwave died. We needed a replacement right away because that's how our household rolls.  I eat popcorn, we microwave veggies.... So, hub and I rushed over to HomeDepot to get a replacement. This GE microwave looked nice. We bought it. We also, thankfully, purchased an insurance policy.<br /><br />Well, 2 weeks ago in May this General Electric microwave died. No electrical response at all. Took it back to HD and they replaced it with another.<br /><br />We assumed it was a fluke. That we just got a bad one. A lemon. NOPE. The second microwave died last night. Same symptoms. No warning. Just died.<br /><br />We are returning this General Electric microwave today. HomeDepot will give us another. However, we are also going to buy another microwave because we know this new GE piece of junk might not last out the week. With another microwave in the house we at least won't have to rush out to acquire another one.<br /><br />Don't buy GE. They might have made good equipment in the past but it's obvious that they are living off their reputation and that they don't have any quality control in their manufacturing process.
I bought this in 2011, and it needed repair (outside of warranty) to the control panel in 2012. The control panel just died again (May 2014), and Samsung won't help. They did offer a free diagnostic visit, but after I asked to speak to a supervisor, they withdrew the offer for the free diagnosis. Chintzy product, poor customer service.
About two weeks prior to this microwave blowing up, we had a problem with it NOT turning off. It would stop if we opened the door, but once we closed the door, it continued to run - nothing showed on the keypad that it was running. We turned off the breaker and left it that way for about 24 hours. When we turned back on the breaker, it seemed to work fine until yesterday. We turned on the fan for about 30 minutes and then turned it off. During the next 20 minutes the microwave turned on by itself and we heard a loud explosion. The microwave was still running! We opened the door and the glass had exploded inside. When we closed the door, the microwave continued to run. We had to turn the breaker off. If we had left our home, the house would have caught fire!!!! We will be contacting Samsung and if they don't provide us with another microwave, we will issue a complaint for this fire hazard.
I bought this microwave three years ago, so the warranty has long expired.  I now have the same problem as everyone else -- the keypad has a short and the microwave is now completely useless.  Have to buy an entirely new microwave, since the cost of repair meets or exceeds the cost of an entirely new microwave.  DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE.
The door wants to catch.  When you push the numbers on the keyboard, they seem cheap.  You have to push hard for them to work right.  This is the second one of same microwave we've had.  Purchased it so wouldn't have to remount hardware.  This second one seems like it's a reject or a second that a store is trying to get rid of.
Only after having the microwave for slightly less than a year, the lettering on the keyboard wore off.<br /><br />Slightly after a year, the microwave totally broke. There was a power outage and subsequently the GE microwave never worked after it.<br /><br />Junk
This is my second unit, replacing one installed in a custom-built cabinet.  I purchased this one solely for dimensional compatibility.  When working, this microwave is excellent in all respects.  It runs quietly, the controls are intuitive and it boasts a number of cooking programs that generally perform well.  Unfortunately, after 5.2 years in service the first unit failed.  I was told the failed component was the magnetron, an expensive part, so I simply replaced it.  I hope the premature failure of the first unit was an aberration.
Do not buy a Samsung Microwave.  Purchased smh1816w January 2013 and in December 2013 stopped working have had 6 service calls and as of April 29 2014 still not working.  A&E service has replaced all parts multiple times to try to correct problem however with no luck.  Samsung is unwilling to replace the unit or refund the money paid which would be preferred. I will never purchase a Samsung product again.
After our GE CafÃ© microwave touchpad went out after only 3 years GE said it would cost $800 to fix.  So we purchased this advantium oven.  It shipped and would not heat up.  We returned it but ended up getting a Breville countertop for $299 that we like much better.
It is perfect for my needs for space.  Size is good and so far performance has been good The extra rack is a nice addition
Device ok after only 2 weeks except that operating touch panel is not the work of genius and not really touch.<br /><br />Big floppy paper templates for wall and overhead marks should be on or glued to stiff cardboard with perforations for marking. Author of directions too expert to convey simple things, failed to consider ceramic tiles on walls need carbide drills. Directions were accurate tho clumsy.
These reviews don't lie. Samsung makes large expensive paper weights. After 1 year and 10 months we too received the 5E or SE error code. Now that it is out of warranty it will be an expensive fix. Pure Garbage. Samsung has the worst customer service. Apparently the error code has to do with a faulty keypad. If you search the error code it says that the steam and heat cause corrosion on the connectors on the keypad board. It is meant to go above stove that creates steam. Samsung needs to make it right and they refuse too. Look at all the poor reviews for this appliance. Shame on Samsung. Never again and that includes all your products.
So many negative reviews on this site. I agonized over getting it, but it fits my space so I did.  It works just fine and I'm happy to recommend it if you're stuck with a cabinet space like me that will only fit this microwave. It is a decent microwave for regular use.
We bought this microwave because it was small and fit our space well, but after owning just a little bit more than a year, the plastic handle broke off at the bottom. Perhaps the glue melted over time? Regardless, we are not happy.  It's cheap.
Why is it, when I am using the microwave I can't use the fan's highest speed. Only 1 and 2, when I press it again the fan's speed goes back to<br />#1. No problem with all speeds if not using the microwave at the same time.
Disapointed in the fan suction. Doesn't seem to be pulling the air from over the stove, almost like there is a ducting leak, because there is plenty of air blowing.
Although they look pretty, we will also never buy another Frigidaire product. Bought a package from another retailer at a reasonable price for what we thought were top-of-the-line Frigidaire products. In less than two years both the microwave and dishwasher needed major repair within a week of one another.....the micro for $240 and the dishwasher for $350.  Repairman recommended we chalk both up as a loss and replace with a different brand as he has seen lots of problems with the Frigidaire product.  Recommend to buyers that you spend a little more upfront because you will save in the end.
Like everyone else our November 2010 purchase has come to be the bane of our kitchen. If you never boil anything on your stove your experience maybe different but if your family requires food to survive I'd opt for a different microwave.
WE had a GE microwave oven burst into flames for no apparent reason.<br />My wife was reheating cup of coffee when the fire occurred. She cut the power and the flame immediately stopped. Her quick thinking averted what could have been a nasty housefire.<br />It was a 2 year old GE Spacemaker Model JVM 1540DP1WW.<br /><br />Our previous Microwave was a similar model GE Spacemaker which quit working at age 3, but did not catch fire.<br /><br />GE assigned a case # 1316274<br /><br /> I sent a report to the USPSC.<br />While researching microwave fires today, I learned that there have been many similar fires reported to GE and the USPSC but neither party has taken any action....GE continues to sell this dangerous appliance and the FEDs continue to record the incidents, but take no action.
Our LG LMV1683ST just caught fire too.<br />Making popcorn like we have countless times before, happened to walk past and noticed flames coming from the roof vent.<br />Luckily we caught it early so were able to put out the flames without too much drama.<br />I called LG and the earliest they can get someone out is next Monday (today is Tuesday).  Actually, I was surprised that the customer service rep didn't express any concern whatsoever about us having a fire in our kitchen, no big deal I guess!<br />And, I have to add that it is vented correctly, I double checked that.  Installed above the stove and room vented.<br />We purchased ours May 2013, it's now March 2014 so it had better still be under warranty.  To be honest, I'm now very uneasy at the thought of getting another one of these, I'd never trust it again.  Thats something I'll be talking to them about after the service tech comes out.<br /><br />Note Added 16/3/14:  I also reviewed microwave on Lowes.com last week but it was not published. Presumably they delete any negative reviews.  Will never trust that site again, after all, it was the positive reviews on that site that made me buy the thing in the first place.<br /><br />Update 17/3/14:  Service Tech came out and said it was the fan cover that caught fire.  The second one he's seen in this area in the past 2 weeks.  Luckily?? we were able to stop the flames before it melted anything but the fan cover itself.  So they are just replacing the fan cover.  Assured me it is a different model though.  They also told me that it happened because we were cooking popcorn (in a microwave popcorn popper) and it was too close to the ceiling.  But, we've used the exact same bowl in 3 different brands of microwaves over the past 10 years without a problem, so I just don't get it.<br />To my dismay, they didn't care about the burn marks on the ceiling of the microwave either.  Sure, it's not a large area, but it's still really noticeable.  Just told me I should be able to get it off with bleach, (which didn't work) or to go out and buy myself some touch up paint.<br />So there you go, up to you if you want to risk buying this model.  I'm not happy at having brown burn marks on the ceiling of a less than 1 year old microwave but their attitude is that it's my problem, not theirs.
Very disappointed in this product. Completely stopped working after about a year. Everything went out on it, would not even power on.
My wife does 90% of the cooking in our home and I asked her what she thought of our new GE Cafe Series CSA1201RSS 1.7 cu. ft. Over-the-Range Advantium Speed Oven & Microwave and she said, &#34;I love it. I may never use our regular (range) oven again&#34;. I use it for the usual things that most men use it for. Popcorn, heating coffee, warming left overs and the like and for me, I think it is also great. It reheats just about anything I have tried to just the right temperature. If there are any cons with this appliance, I haven't run across them yet.
Be purchased all Bosch appliances in 2011.<br /><br />Refrigerator went out twice. It was past warranty so Bosch would not cover. Then we found out it was covered through the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. Once we got them involved it was eventually repaired then replaced after more and more problems.<br /><br />Now microwave ( HMV 3051) completely died. Only 2.5 years old with moderate use. Bosch will not help and unfortunately it does not have Good Housekeeping seal. We will replace with non Bosch model that does
We've had this convection oven now for about 2 years and while we are pretty happy with the microwave portion, the convection feature is not satisfactory. Because of the smaller Volume compared to a regular range you would assume that the oven heats up faster or doesn't even need to preheat at all, as we were used to with our previous model from Kitchenaid. But this model takes actually about twice as long as our regular oven and therefore we hardly use the convection feature. So if you are looking for a good convection oven, this is not it.
Everything works perfectly, after several months of using. IT looks great and it is pretty smart. However, I am annoyed by continuous error beeps.
We had this for less than 2 years and the door handle fell off. It is held onto the microwave door with cheap plastic parts.
We got the whole  suite of Whirlpool appliances with our new house. Every piece: fridge, dishwasher and this microwave gave us only grief and never ending service calls. And this is after only 4 months of using them, they all fall apart. This oven has a nice display, however, while cooking the door sucks in all the water vapor from below cooking top and the moisture sits there for hours where all the electronics are. It is hooked up to the outside vent however it blows all the hot air back to the kitchen instead of the pipe in the wall. I have technician look at it again this weekend. Save yourself the aggravation and  but Samsung or other high quality brand, Whirlpool quality is a history at this point.
Nice looking microwave but has many problems. Lasted exactly 3 years then I had to replace. Since it is an over the range model that means you may be cooking things under it on the range that create steam. When the steam rises it gets into the electronics of the keyboard and shorts it out. replaced the keyboard at 2 yrs (forgot cost but was not cheap) and finally it has finally died. Poorly designed. Do not recommend.
I've only had this for less than a month and, full disclosure, I didn't purchase it from Amazon but got the exact same model from Best Buy (I should have read the reviews here first before it was installed!).    The good:  It looks nice; the stainless steel finish must have some kind of coating on it because it's much easier to clean than some of my other steel appliances; the overall size is decent on the inside.  When it's cooking, I have to say this is the quietest microwave I've ever owned.    The not-so-good:  I've never had an over-the-range microwave with the handle on the door before and I hadn't really given that feature much thought before making the purchase.  It looks nice and all, but the handle gets untouchably hot if you're cooking on the stove;  I don't think I'd ever buy another with a handle again because it's kind of a nuisance to have to use an oven mitt to open the microwave (even more of a nuisance if I forget to use a mitt and put my hand on hot stainless steel).  It's very hard to see inside of when food is cooking.  There's one bulb and it's quite dim, plus the door has a screen-printed pattern on it that makes it even harder to see into.  The exhaust fan for the range technically has two settings, but they sound almost identical... and it's VERY loud. If the microwave is running for a long period of time or if it starts getting overheated from the stove below, the fan automatically turns on.  It's a smart feature to prevent it from overheating, but again the fan is super loud, and you can't manually turn it off once it kicks on.    The bad:  Oh. My. God.  The freakin' beeps when it's done cooking are INSANE!  I've never, ever had a microwave that didn't stop beeping upon the door being opened.  Not only does this continue, but the 3 beeps are extremely loud and at least 5-6 seconds long each!  And if you don't open the door in a timely fashion, it doesn't remind you with a gentle, short beep;  instead you get the same 3 ear-shattering YokoOno-screeching beeps every 2 minutes.  I've found that if you hit the stop/cancel button before opening the door, it'll stop the beeping... but again, it's another nuisance that I've never had to deal with in any previous microwaves.    The other bad thing I've found is that the touch pad scratches EXTREMELY easily.  I only use a microfiber cloth on it and it still looks like I went at it with steel wool covered in broken glass.  I tried using a plastic/fiberglass polish and it didn't do a thing.  However, I've found that using granite countertop cleaner/polish at least minimizes the look of the scratches a bit.    Overall, I'd advise people against purchasing this model.  Its negatives outweigh the positives... especially when there are so many other, better choices out there.
I am having the same issue but the keypad goes dark as soon as you press start so the error code does not come on. Samsung would not fix this. They want me to pay for a repairman to come out here to fix. After all of the reviews you would think they would want to fix and save their reputation. I will never buy Samsung again, as I had a Tv that also had issues that they knew about and would not fix. If I pay for a repairman I might as well get a new microwave for that price and it won't be a Samsung!!!!!!
Despite the high percentage of negative reviews here, I recently bought this unit to replace a very similar Frigidaire unit which developed a &#34;fatal&#34; magnetron  failure after 10 years of heavy use. I can't understand all of the bad reviews regarding the &#34;beeps&#34; and user interface, possibly because they don't seem odd to me. (You can always turn it off just before the beep if it annoys you.)<br /><br />Of course, I will be as unhappy as some of the other reviewers if it fails quickly, but after such a good experience with our previous one I decided to take the chance. It also gets much better reviews a lot of other places with a much larger &#34;sample&#34; of reviewers. So far we love it as much as it's predecessor, but I'll report back if it conks out quickly.
This review is as much for this product as is for Consumer Reports. Bought all new appliances for a new cabin we built and used Consumer Reports recommendation to buy these appliances. This was one these purchases and was given an excellent review by the Consumer Reports people!!!<br /><br />Lasted just over a year and quit working. GE wants $75 just to look at it before telling me how much in parts and labor they will charge me to repair it. I can buy another company's 2.2 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Countertop Microwave for $89 today brand new with full warranty! Ah...no thanks!<br /><br />My old 29 year old Panasonic is still working great and heats food just as well as this one if not better. I think I'll take my own advice now instead of Consumer Reports and buy another Panasonic!<br /><br />UPDATE: Found out the inverter board is bad...GE wants $250 for a new part + $75 service trip charge and another $75 for repair = $400 total repair cost for a microwave oven just over a year old when one of these brand new is just under $300!!!
Among the other problems mentioned, the glass panel in the door shatters when the convection oven goes over 400 degrees. And don't even think about installing a new door yourself, as GE insists only their repair people can do the work for $150 plus the cost of the door. Zero stars would be totally appropriate.
The fan will come on by itself at random times and will not turn off until I unplug the microwave.  This happened several times over a period of a couple months then again occasionally.  This started happening about 2 years into using it.  It hasn't happened recently, probably not for the last 9 months or more.  Hopefully, it will not return.  The fan is also fairly loud to the point you have to elevate your voice to carry on a conversation.  Everything else is average but it sure looks nice and that is why I was foolish enough to buy it. I would have given it one star if not for the fact you can work around the problem by unplugging it and plugging it back in to get the fan to turn off and I can live with the noise it makes.
I was initially impressed with this oven. But in less than three months it was trouble. As other reviewers have said, the oven will turn itself on. The plastic exterior will crack due to the heat from the range. And whirlpool has made customer satisfaction a priority despite the numerous complaints about this oven. My oven was ultimately replaced by my builder under the builders warranty guarantee. The replacement oven (brand new) also cracked and continues to malfunction intermitently. Whirlpool should recall all of this garbage and offer replacements. I think it is legally and certainly morally wrong to continue to sell this inferior, overpriced, and potentially dangerous product especially since that have been notified of problems that can be documented by the repair companies they contract to service these thing.<br /><br />I am thoroughly disappointed in this product and the lack of customer support from Whirlpool.
Good unit<br />Easy to install as I. Was replacing old unit<br />Color was as expected it to be when opened
The door has a huge dent in it. Makes me suspicious of how &#34;new&#34; the product is or if it is a factory second or something  returned by another purchaser.
I was just heating my lunch and once the cycle ended (fan, light and turn table turned off) the heating keep going. The only way to make it stop is to unplug. Seems like many people are having the same issue after just a couple years. I just read on the forums that  the control board is the issue which costs around $160. Piece of crap. Poor design, and also the timer is useless and other featured that are annoying. Stay away from this product.
I bought a Samsung SMH9187W over the oven microwave in 2010 at Sears. ($249.00) Looked nice and worked well.<br /><br />Here is a warning. Don't have a steaming pot under the control panel for an extended time. Moisture ruins the control panel.<br /><br />I cooked homemade soup on the burner below the control panel. The steam from cooking so long, ruined a part in the panel. It never worked again. I got an Se5 code when I tried to turn it on. Looked it up on the internet. Indicated moisture damage to something. Be careful.
I love the microwave but their answer to how do you clean the glass door was, cover your food and you shouldn't have to clean it! I always cover my food yet sometimes the saran wrap breaks and things splatter! How you could put a fine grate between the food and the glass and expect food not to splatter is beyond me. Samsung  makes great tv's and electronics, but stay away from appliances as they obviously do not have a clue! In the meantime, I paid top dollar for what I thought was a great product. Little did I know I'm now stuck with something that makes me look like I'm a total slob in my kitchen. Thanks Samsung!
I absolutely cannot believe the experience we have had with this microwave model!!!  Take it off the freaking shelves already. RECALL IT.  The same issue over and over again - all within 6 to 8 months for each one that was replaced!  The unit just explodes with a horrible electric cracking sound while it is running.  There is an electrical short that fries the insides.  3 microwaves later, here we are once again calling the warranty man.  DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL!
This came with the townhouse I bought in May 2013. It is now Jan. 2014 and it's dead. The date of manufacture is July 2011. Came on here to buy another and read all the reviews....THANK you ...now I know to replace it with a different brand. It's not even 2 years old. Unfortunately, the previous owners bought the whole shebang so I own the same brand/model oven, fridge and dishwasher...AHHHHH....that doesn't bode well for me, does it? Hopefully the microwave is the worst of them and I'll get more use out of the rest of them. Frigidaire is an Electrolux company. Thanks again for the reviews.<br />Beth
Had this microwave for approximately 2 years and it just quit.  It's heavy and difficult to install as when you don't have a direct vent, you must turn the vent around prior to mounting it.  The worse part is it just didn't last.
I bought this microwave a little over 2 years ago, and it was just okay. I really didn't like the way it functioned compared to previous microwaves I have owned. but it looked good, and worked fine; UNTIL YESTERDAY.<br /><br />Out of nowhere, it just went up in flames, it wasn't even in use at the time.<br /><br />The only one in the house was my 72 yr. old mother-in-law, she said she noticed earlier that morning, the display on the microwave was off and she was unable to use it (as if it was unplugged). A while later, the house filled with smoke. Smoke and  flames were shooting out of the top vent of the microwave. She said there was so much smoke she could not even see in the kitchen.  She called 911, the fire dept was dispatched, and she exited our home. By the time they arrived the fire had burned out on its own, and the damage was contained to the internals of the microwave. The fire crew removed the microwave from my home, and inspected the home to insure that the microwave was indeed the cause of the fire. Thankfully there was no damage to our home other than the microwave itself, and a strong odor of smoke and burnt plastic (I'm sure it will take weeks to get rid of the smell).<br /><br />I contacted Samsung, to report what happened and am awaiting a response from the Executive Customer Relations dept. do to the nature of the incident.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what I want from them, more than anything to create awareness. Maybe they will issue a recall, based on this and all of the negative reviews I have read here on Amazon. I would encourage others having problems with this model to report it to Samsung. It may not do you much good, but who knows, you could save a life or something.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/31/2014:<br />Samsung Executive Customer Relations department contacted me on 01/20/2014 (MLK Holiday), by telephone (cell phone). I was asked to provide the microwave serial number but did not have it with me, so we agreed that I would provide it via email. A short time later I received an email asking to provide the serial number as Samsung would like to locate a service center to diagnose the unit.  I responded later that day with the serial number.<br /><br />On 01/21/2014 I received a response which stated, based on the serial number provided, the microwave is out of warranty, but due to the nature of the problem Samsung will cover the cost of diagnostics, and a service center will contacting me.<br /><br />On 01/22/2014 I received a call from the service center informing me they received the service order from Samsung, but it states the microwave is out of warranty so I will be responsible for the payment, I asked them to double check with Samsung, but they said I would have to contact them. I sent an email explaining what the service center said, and a few hours later Samsung responded with a One time Accommodation for the labor which I assume was also sent to the service center.<br /><br />A few days later the service center contacted me again, explaining they received the accommodation from Samsung, and asked if I could deliver the microwave to them, which I agreed (they were only about 1 mile from my home).<br /><br />On 01/29/14 the service center contacted me to explain that several parts in the microwave short circuited, and required replacement.  They explained that the accommodation was for diagnostic labor only, and any further repair would be my responsibility.  They asked for direction; explaining that the parts required are expensive, and the repair would most likely exceed the cost of replacement.<br /><br />I sent another email to Samsung explaining the call from the service center.  I explained that I made it a point to buy appliances from well know major brands such as Samsung with the expectation of higher quality and long life.  I asked that given the fact the unit failed due to a short circuit, after such a short life, under normal residential use, that they consider replacing the microwave at no cost, despite the fact the warranty period had ended.  Not to mention it almost burned my house down.<br /><br />It has been over 48 hours sense the email was sent and I have not received a response from Samsung. I have instructed the service center to recycle the microwave if they do not hear otherwise from me (or Samsung) by Monday (today is Friday).<br /><br />If I get a response from Samsung, I will update the review.he microwave at no cost, despite the fact the warranty period had ended.

We initially were happy with our purchase of this microwave, although it did not have the features of the older, more expensive Dacor microwave it replaced.  The size was great, and we liked the easy clean interior.<br /><br />However, six months after it was purchased (right before Christmas), it failed totally - would not power up at all.  I called Samsung customer service, they said a tech would get in touch shortly.  After 3 days a local repair company called to say they only came to our area once a week, so it would be several days before they could stop by.  We're 30 miles from Salt Lake City in Park City, a major resort town with a winter population of 100,000 people, so it's not like we're in the sticks.<br /><br />Nine days after I called, the repair service showed up.  He repaired one part, then stated that the magnetron was damaged, and that he would need to take the microwave to his shop for more diagnosis and repair.  Then he would have to order parts, then he would bring it back when his route brought him to our area again - so, two more weeks at least (assuming Samsung has the parts in stock).  On the way out of the door he banged the microwave into our door frame, putting a major dent in it.<br /><br />I called Samsung customer service again, and stated that I thought three weeks or more was too long to repair the unit.  They blamed the tech for not bringing all the parts he might need (what, a whole microwave?) but refused to offer to even expedite parts to the repair shop to cut a week off the time, let alone discuss any kind of replacement.<br /><br />With a family of 5, we use a microwave multiple times a day.  Samsung should have better quality in the first place.  When they have a failure, they need to have a better repair and support system in place, and if they can't do better than 3 weeks or more to repair an appliance that gets used daily, that's not good enough for me.  Do you need a failure like this right before you have family coming for the holidays? Would you be happy to spend weeks with a giant empty space in your kitchen where your microwave (and oven hood) was?<br /><br />We don't. No more Samsung appliances for us.  And good luck to Samsung in taking on Whirlpool, Bosch, Asko, Panasonic, etc. - the other appliances we have in our house which have worked great with daily use for years.  I'm off to the store for another brand of microwave, look for this one on eBay - still under warranty!<br /><br />By the way, we tried to post a version of this review (edited in accordance with Samsung.com's review guidelines) on Samsung.com, where Samsung supposedly allows customers to rate their products (and this microwave currently has a 4 star review).  We received a notice today that they would not post our review--no rationale, only that it did not meet their standards. BUYER BEWARE!
Just bought house with this unit in the house.<br /><br />It looks good.  The controls are awkward, the timer and fast button controls are not intuitive.<br /><br />However, it worked fine, has light under it and fan that works ok.<br /><br />My wife cooks popcorn init and it flames up, my wife throws the now burning popcorn bag in the sink and we clean it up.  The unit fails to start at all.<br /><br />I have never had anything flame in a microwave, especially with no metal or tin-foil at all involved, and fear replacing with the same brand, so looking at other.<br /><br />I definately would steer clear of these units as they seem to have multiplel issues.
I know I purchased a refurbished unit, but a noticeable dent on the face of it is unacceptable.  I'm returning this unit.
This is a terrible product and brand. We have had the microwave less than two years and it is now worthless. The turntable will not turn and the unit will not heat things up. Called LG and they refused to give any help or assistants.
We needed a microwave that was not very deep and a bit wider to fit in our cabinet. We struggled to find the right dimensions for our built in cabinet cubby. This one is a perfect fit. I was concerned it would not be powerful enough since the watts are lower than many others, so far it has worked great for our needs. Plus it looks great in the space.
Bigger than previous Microwave - larger form factor, had to do some work to retro fit and replace previous Microwave.<br />Easy to use, works well, heats food evenly.
I understand there are instructions you can enter to turn the beep off, but then I'd probably forget food is in there.  When the food is done it IMMEDIATELY starts an obnoxious beep and continues to do so with 20 second breaks.  If the beeping started TWO MINUTES after something was cooked I'd be okay with it since most instructions say to let food sit for two minutes after cooking.  We have to take food out right away to stop the beeping, or open the door and let it sit with the light on.  Just a poor design in that way.  Seems to cook normally and looks good.  Still running okay after about 18 months.  I came on here thinking if prices had dropped I'd buy a spare (I figure they all die after 5-10 years and they are a pain to match in looks) but after reading the reviews will save my money til I really need one and buy something else.
Verry good appliance don't have any of the issues i saw posted before i bought it only one thing should warn buyers it is a green appliance so no in microwave light sorry but other than that works like a charm.
If you are by nature an angry person this is the microwave for you, as trying to use it will do nothing but make you angry.  If you pound on it just the right way, it will work for week or two, then quit. It worked for about a year, then started shorting out.  I had it repaired, but the repair only lasted about two months.  It's only few years old and hasn't been used much but it's already worn out the door latch is loose and won't close.  The warranty is only a year, which is no doubt how Bosche stays in business.  Stay away.
This worked fine until it did - which is less than 24 months. Within the duration, the spring lock for the door broke - and now I get the SE error. Which means the unit is toast and I now need to look for a new one. Am not going to buy another Samsung appliance.
the microwave has work very nice, a bit pricy thou but in the long run it will have been a good inventment as my wife loves to coooook.
Just moved into apartment where this had been installed new. Cooks OK so far (although not encouraged by the rest of the reviews here) but otherwise designed to frustrate -- minor features you've taken for granted after several decades of microwaving are nowhere to be found.<br /><br />- As others have mentioned, the three obnoxiously long beeps after cooking are bad enough; that they don't stop once you've opened the door is bonkers. And once you've opened the door, you're committed -- hit Clear all you want, you're getting the beeps. HOWEVER, if you hit Clear BEFORE you open the door, you can snip the beeps, which is good but why is the sequence an issue at all?<br /><br />- Can't set the timer and cook concurrently. Sorry multitaskers.<br /><br />- Clock gains between 2-3 minutes each day -- last synced with the stove (same brand, brand new) a month ago, and they're now 2 1/2 hours apart.<br /><br />- No way to open or close the door quietly, can only jerk it open and pop it shut.
One of the pieces that ensures the screws from the top of the cabinet holds the microwave in place was missing, so we cannot install it until Samsung rectifies the matter.  Seems crazy to send it back though since it's just missing a 50 cent bolt that can't be replaced at the hardware store.....
I received and installed the microwave. So far, I am pleased with it.<br /><br />It was damaged in shipping (a dent on the top back edge. This does not affect the installation or operation. I noted that a number of other reviewers had damage in shipping. This needs to be fixed. Better packaging and selection of carrier might help.<br /><br />The hardware (toggle bolts) were cheap and just fell apart when I used them. i had to use other hardware to install the unit.<br /><br />The template is a bit off. I had to redrill the holes for the top cabinet to get it to fit. I measured the holes on the unit and found the template was off about 3/4 of an inch.
Had this microwave for 3 years with very little usage within that period of time. The infamous F7 error code showed up and service rep replaced the inverter and still had a problem after inverter replacement. After a $400 repair bill, the inverter was only partial problem. The magnetron has to be replaced for another $200. Whirlpool use to be a great appliance to purchase but now I would not suggest buying another whirlpool appliance.
Had one about 20 yrs. that was losing power.  New one has added features that are helpful - esp. sensor cooking.<br />Price is up there esp. for stainless steel.
This is the SECOND one of these that has blown up on me in 8 months. I don't recommend it at all.
This is an absolute crappy microwave. I'm thankful I didn't spend a dime on it since it was a Christmas Present. The entire appliance is shoddy. After using it for about a year, the door handle began to show cracks and eventually just cracked completely which compromised the glass panel on the front door. Eventually the entire circuit board shorted out when I was simply changing the light bulb. My husband and I did not misuse this appliance and we certainly  weren't &#34; hard&#34; on it. It's simply a poorly made appliance.
Piece of junk. Got two years of use and it died. Customer service says too bad. Whirlpool dishwasher died a few months ago. Whirlpool is dead to me.
I did not buy this microwave on Amazon, but felt compelled to add to the feedback as I buy many other products here using the customer reviews.  I bought this microwave 2 years and 2 weeks ago.  It completely failed last night.  It was running as normal, got very loud, then completely died.  I've reset breakers and checked that power is still being supplied.  Everything checks out.  Samsung wants $288 for the service contract to fix it, but as of this posting, that's how much a new microwave costs.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this microwave.
So far, so good.  I have no complaints, but it's only been in use for about 6 months.  If I start noticing the same wear and tear (i.e. peeling paint on the interior), I'll post an update.  We use this appliance several times a day, everyday.
Worked fine for 13 months then it stop heating food and it does not show any error messages. Searched on online for a solution to the problem and found that running the fan on high works for some people. I gave it a try and YES it does work. The only way to heat our food is by turning the fan on HIGH before setting the time and pushing the start button. Our microwave is installed under a cabinet but not above any stove or range, so steam or moisture is not the problem. I called Samsung and their only solution was for me to buy their extended warranty for $250.00 for one year. I told them No Thanks, if I'm going to spend more money on a microwave it won't be on a Sumsung.
After the smoke has cleared from the house, discovered microwave burnt out.  Thank God for Home Warranty!  Don't buy! YUCK!  Can't believe the reviews- all universally the same, except mine lasted just under a year!  It's a crying shame a product fails so soon!
Like 2 of the 9 reviewers here at the time of this writing, the microwave arrived damaged.  Heavily dented and deformed on the back and side, and this one is uninstallable as a result.  3 out of 10 damaged isn't very impressive!  Obviously I can't comment on the function.  If you order, make sure to inspect the unit before wasting time reading all the installation instructions and getting the template in place, etc....
It's a nice looking Microwave and it does a great job (when it works). Ours failed 2 weeks after the warranty expired. Repair cost was more than buying a new one so we ended up getting a new one.
The clock runs fast, gaining about 5 minutes ever day. It also heats very unevenly. We've owned it for a month. I'm looking forward to the total breakdown described on the rest of these reviews so that I can get a new one.
Display didn't light up so unit wasn't usable when it first arrived. GE service was pleasant and resolved after 2nd visit.  A few days later, the light under the microwave stopped working.  2 issues in less than a month doesn't bode well..  Also you can only heat in 15 sec increments when using the time dial.  But the good news...options for preconfigured settings for various items and their cooking times (potato, veg, etc...)  are fairly substantial and works efficiently.  HOWEVER.... I wouldn't recommend installing the microwave above your stove. Since the microwave is faced in stainless steel, the door handle and face of microwave gets extremely hot to the touch while cooking on the stovetop.  Speaking of the stove, I had much better luck with GEs CafÃ© Dual Range Gas stove.  Bought at the same time. No issues. Works great. Highly recommend stove without any hesitation. Absolutely love it!!!!! Wish I felt the same about the microwave.
DO NOT BUY!<br />We just got the SE error after 2.5 years - they know about the problem and haven't fixed it.  I looked it up on the internet after this happened and tons of people have this problem.  I'm not going to pull the whole thing apart to fix it and then have it happen again.  If they know the moisture causes the key pad to fail then why do they have it above a range where you boil water!
While searching for others with the same problem we're having I found these reviews: our Advantium died in about 2 1/2 years. We work from home and, one day, smelled smoke that we traced to our Advantium which was turned off and that had been turned off for some time. It was hot to the touch. We unplugged the Advantium and the the smoke smell went away: it had spontaneously turned on and was melting itself down. Plugging it back in turns it on without pressing any buttons. GE says this is not a fire hazard because there are supposed to be safety's to prevent it from burning down the house. I'm not so sure -- their credibility is shot -- but even if there are those safety's are built with the same low quality as the Advantium so cannot be reasonably relied upon. GE says the problem is with the keypad but that there aren't any more keypads to buy, probably because they all fail. The Advantium is a piece of junk. Save yourself money and protect your family from this potential fire hazard: avoid GE appliances.    [Update: after several calls and an eternity on hold GE acknowledged the problem and send a tech with a new Advantium that seems to be working well. I wouldn't buy another -- there are clearly QA issues with the Advantium -- but after lots of time on the phone GE did make this right. I'd still prefer a different manufacturer though and wish I'd bought a different cooker. If you're in the market for a microwave/cooker buy a different one.]
I purchased a PEM31SMSS GE microwave because fit in the space I have, and also look good, but let me tell you if you thinking buying some thing like this PICE OF JUNK, only going to last you the most 2 years, or less that is what it lass me, when you call GE they ready to sell you a new one problably with the same problems.
Worthless.  Stopped working after less than two years.  The repair place said it would be about $200.00 to fix it.  If you're like me, you are considering a Frigidaire because they're cheaper.  Do yourself a favor and spend a little more on another brand.
I haven't had the same electronic problem as other reviewers and the microwave itself is working fine.  At six months the handle fell off.  Since it was under warranty still, Samsung customer service sent a technician with a new door and replaced it.  Now at 14 months with the warranty expired the new door handle feel off again.  This is clearly a design flaw in the way the door is constructed.  You cannot use the microwave without being able to close the door.  They have refused to replace the microwave or fix the door - very disappointing customer experience.
We do not have this exact model. We have a SMH 9187st. Ours is three years old and just recently got the dreaded 5E/SE error. I found online that if you called them they would cover it under an Epidemic Warranty for the specific problem of the 5E keypad error. . Called they sent a local repair man out in less than 7 days all fixed at NO CHARGE.  I feel like Samsung is well aware of this issue and with and will stand behind their products . I would buy another one after this experience.
Cheaper price is the only thing I really liked about this. We had it installed in our new house and have been using it for about a year now. At first it was fine, but after a few months I kept hearing this 'whizzing' sound. I found out it was the cover for the lightbulb inside the microwave, it got loose! How does that even happen? Can't fix it myself so we have to call their appliance repair which I'm regretting as that's always a hassle.<br /><br />It heats as a microwave should, I'm just disappointed that it's starting to fall apart already after just 1 year of use.<br /><br />The beeping is annoying, I'm sorry it just is. When you have a sleeping baby and this thing goes off and it wont turn off when you open the door, then yes it is annoying!! We did recently figure out that if you press stop/cancel while it's beeping, it will stop. But really? Seems like a silly thing to be upset about, but it can get on your nerves over time.<br /><br />Hopefully Frigidaire fixes all the problems with it!
The poor reviews of this product must have involved a bad batch. This microwave has worked great for us. Very powerful great look and fits in a very tight space. I really like the one touch timer feature. It seems to be well built. Ours has a sticker inside that says built April 2013. I am glad we got a more recent built unit than what seems to be problems with earlier units.
I put a SMH9187ST 1.8 cu. ft. Over-the-Range Microwave (Stainless Steel) in my vacation home.  After four or five months of light duty use, we returned home to find the door standing open and the light on inside.  There is apparently a spring in the door that holds the two latches in the closed position.  That spring either came off its mount or broke, because the latches no longer hold the door closed.  I asked Samsung to tell me how to open up the door so I could replace the spring.  They said no, I'd have to pay them for a service call.  I asked if they would tell me how to remove the door so I could take it to a local repair shop.  No, again.  Keep in mind that the spring apparently failed while the unit was just sitting there, not in use.  The really scary part of this is that if it had failed during use, the door would have opened on its own potentially allowing a major leakage of microwave energy into the kitchen.  ,
This microwave works well and is efficient. It does make more noise than my last one but it makes up for it in performance. Would not hesitate to purchase again.
My so-called top of the line GE Profile microwave burned out and had a bad tube after only 3 years so I needed a microwave that would match all my appliances and didn't want to make the mistake of spending a fortune on a microwave again since nothing seems to last anymore.  I really liked the Samsung looks and the price compared to the other big brands was enticing but I read tons of negative reviews and held off on buying it.  A few weeks later I see it on sale from its already great price and bought it $230.  It sticks out about an inch more beyond my cabinets than the ge did but I think this is intentional as the exhaust vent blows out of the top toward the front of the unit.  This actually provides better coverage when cooking on the stove top as well since everything rises right up into the vent hood.  It's been a year and a half and it still works great.  It's just as powerful as the ge was so either it's under rated or the ge was over rated in wattage.  For under 300 bucks you can't go wrong with this microwave.  The stainless doesn't mark up with smudges as easy as my other appliances and it has just as many features as the more expensive ones.  It's controls are lot easier to use than the touch screen was on my ge.  Fyi don't get a touch screen appliance!!  I like the 4 fan speeds.  My only complaint is when the kitchen timer goes off it just beeps once and it's easy to miss it.  Other than that I'm really surprised at how great this microwave has turned out and though I haven't had to deal with customer service personally I've heard they're very easy to deal with which is more than I can say for ge.  Goodbye GE and good job Samsung.
Bought under 3 years ago.  First the door stopped closing fully unless you slammed it.  Now all it does is work for 5 seconds and then stops working.  Total JUNK!  Total waste of money.  Now I need to buy a new microwave...AGAIN!
This was bought as part of a package of kitchen equipment in May 2013.<br /><br />Currently it hasn't worked for 1/4 of the time I have owned it.<br /><br />As other reviewers have identified there is a known issue where they stop working and don't response at all - Samsung executive customer service refuses to do anything outside the attempt to 'repair it 3 times process'.<br /><br />There is nothing good to say about Samsung, their product, their staff or their agencies - to continue to sell a product that is known to be deficient is negligent<br /><br />I own other Samsung products but because of this I will never buy one again and make sure I can influence others to do likewise.<br /><br />Please don't buy this product - it will most likely fail and you will wish you hadn't...<br /><br />I certainly regret it
This is a very handsome appliance and for the first year it operated well or as expected. Within weeks of the first year anniversary the microwave died, an operating board went out and it no longer functioned and the repair would cost almost as much as replacing the product. I contacted GE and they instructed me to have a repairman to come in and diagnose the problem, if I decided to repair or replace they would give me credit for the service call, but because the warranty had just run out they would not be responsible for replacing the product.
We installed this above an Electrolux dual-fuel oven, for which it provides venting and downward-facing LED lights in addition to its primary microwave functions. It was fairly inexpensive and looks good in the kitchen.  Observations in no particular order:<br /><br />1. The sensor cooking on this is much better than on our old Sharp countertop unit, which overcooked everything.  I had thought at the time that it would be nice if there was a way to calibrate the sensor.  While the Samsung doesn't give you calibration options, it does let you say what you are cooking, and apparently adjusts its response to the sensor accordingly.  I have found that it works pretty well to always tell it I'm reheating pasta!<br /><br />2. A general-use kitchen timer is provided.  Of course most microwaves do, so that's not unusual, but this one is smarter than some.  It is able to function independently of the cooking timer.  For example, if you are timing something for 30 minutes, then decide partway through you want to heat a cup of water for one minute, it will correctly keep track of the 30 minute timer in the background and display it again after it's done with the water.<br /><br />3. Minor niggle: the oven vent is supposed to come on whenever it detects heat rising from below, but ours seems to always need to be turned on manually.<br /><br />4. This is where the Samsung loses a review star.  The Eco Mode feature is poorly conceived.  When you press the button, the panel lights go out and standby power consumption is reduced.  So far, so good.  But then as as soon as you use the microwave again, or even just open the door, or use the oven light or vent options, it leaves eco mode; the display comes back on and STAYS on.  It really should remember eco as a user preference rather than as a temporary mode.  I also suspect this ties in to the problems some customers have had with the control panel failing.  If we were allowed to set a persistent eco mode, it's likely that the front panel would be mostly-off except when in actual operation, and as a result it might not burn out.  We have made it a habit to push the eco button after each use.<br /><br />In sum, it fits with our kitchen decor and cooks well, and we hope we will be able to make it last a long time by remembering the eco button as often as possible.
It was ok. Convection and bake worked OK. A lot of buttons to push just to get it to go. Usually I hit the 30 second button and then turned the knob. Also cannot see non illuminated buttons in a semi- dark corner of kitchen. However, the unit stopped working after 17 months. Just passed the warranty. Not happy.
We bought this Microwave at Lowes.  I think I would have a better chance at solving a Rubik's than installing the thing over the stove so we hired our handyman to do it.<br /><br />The microwave performs OK but the stainless steel began rusting in 9 months.  It is now pockmarked with rust and getting uglier every day.<br /><br />I regret this purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Here I am a little more than a year after posting my original 1-star review, and I'm wishing there was zero star option.  One day about 2 hours after dinner the light inside the microwave randomly came on all by itself! The unit was previously off. Upon closer inspection we noticed not only was the light on, but the turntable was also turning. If we open the door, the turntable stops spinning. If we close it, it begins again. And the light remains on.<br /><br />Sometimes when we're done cooking something it will power off normally like its supposed to and we get lulled into a false sense that it fixed itself. But then it will randomly come on again later.<br /><br />It's acting like its possessed.  My guess is that all LG products are pure evil, and should be avoided.
Samsung might make tons of nice product but Oven range Microwave is not one of them. Seems like 5E or SE code seems to be the common problem with their microwave.<br />My warranty was just about to run out and I've been getting this code. I should have doing research before I went with them. Live and learn I suppose.
Amazing that such a reputable company would put out such a poorly thought out product.<br /><br />Everyone should know by now that the most important part of a microwave oven is the user interface.  Afterall, a microwave oven has one power setting that must be somehow regulated by an on/off switch  - so I am amazed that Frigidaire could mess that up so.<br /><br />For instance:  when it is done cooking - the 3 loud beeps go off VERY SLOWLY.  During which time it is impossible to add time, or even to stop the beeping.  You can open the door, but it still beeps;  you can not push the stop button, because until the beep is done - NOTHING ELSE WORKS -  This thing is robbing my time a few seconds at a time.<br /><br />Who is the Frigidaire executive that pushed this forward with out simple end user testing?<br /><br />Skip it... Underpowered for it's size and frustrating to use.
18 month old microwave will not stop running until unplugged, which is a complete fire hazard and deemed unsafe.  I will never purchase a Frigidaire product in my lifetime again, or recommend it to anyone.  This is not the first 18 month old Frigidaire product I will have to replace.  STOP NOW if you are considering this product brand!!!
It worked for three weeks and now it won't start. Luckily we kept the box and are sending it back. What a pain.
It's too bad that this microwave gets such poor reviews. I had it in my old house, and I'd really like to get another one for my new house. But even now I'm a bit hesitant.<br /><br />I see that a lot of people have problems, but luckily, I had none. I love the looks of the microwave, and I love the LCD touch controls. I also love the sensor cooking, especially with baked potatoes and corn on the cob.<br /><br />Perhaps my only complaint is that the exhaust fan is loud. The weird thing is that it is just as loud, if not louder, at low fan settings. At these low settings, there's a loud hum, and at high settings, there's the fan noise. Therefore, even if you're just boiling an egg or something, you have to put up with the loud fan noise all the time.<br /><br />The interior is VERY easy to clean. After 4 years, the thing looks brand new. I thought it was pretty well built.
Bought this product a while ago. Handle breaks off over time. GE knows of the problem. Charges $60 for the handle and delivers it without screws. One of those broke as well. On line parts support says the handle does not come with screws and there is nothing they can do. Live and learn.
I should have heeded the warnings in these reviews.  We bought this because it fit our space, but the door button broke.  The door won't open when the button is pushed, it just unlatches and you have to pry it open.  What's worse, the GE repairman came to fix it and he just added some lubrication and said it was fine.  He refused to replace anything.
Bought Over The Range GE Microwave PVM1790SR1 SS Unpacked it. Before installing , plugged it in to test.It started automatically, control panel went dark no amount of pressin STOP/CANCEL button would stop it from running.<br />Returned the product yesterday.
At first glance this appliance looks good but the trim is poorly attached and is coming off after three months of use.  it does not have enough power to properly pop popcorn.  It takes 2-3 minutes to boil a cup of water.  If you  build a cabinet to fit it for a built in look, you will have a hard time finding a replacement that will fit into the space.  I would definitely NOT recommend this microwave
Same as every one else..this microwave is three years old ..broke twice ! They know they have an SE problem and continue to sell their junk!  Same as everyone else they want you to pay to fix it...told us last time we got it fixed they resolved the problem...well broke again SE AGAIN ..so I will never buy from them again...I will tell everyone I know not to buy their junk ..is it really worth it to screw people over like that?
After 16 months the board that controls the keypad died. The repair estimate was twice what I paid for the microwave! Repair person told me to get a whirlpool or LG next time.
I have just gone through 10 weeks of kitchen remodel that was supposed to take 5-6 weeks. I researched venting microwaves and found very good reports on this one. The availability and price here on Amazon beat my local big box stores and chains. Installation appeared easy for my contractors. There are options to allow venting outside, either behind or above the microwave (not so clear from product description) but we had planned to vent through filters as the only other option was through our garage (not compatible with local code).<br /><br />The bells and whistles are amazing, with our kids ready to show us how it works, right after we stop the clock blinking on our VCR.
We own this microwave in black. Installed in 2010, slow to cook for 3 years, and finally broke in 2013 - magnetron went out. Too costly to repair, so replaced with a Whirlpool unit (fingers crossed). 3 years for an appliance that requires install - WHAT A JOKE! I also had a GE range break in less than 3 years. I own multiple rental houses and used to count on GE. Now I will NEVER buy a GE appliance again!
You'd expect more than five years out of a product in this price range. However, the control panel died after five years.  Well not quite died.  You can still make things happen, it's just not always what you expect.  You hit the 3 and you get 4.  You hit the Start button and it goes to Help.  On top of that, the fan filters are really flimsy, the tab you use to take them out to clean broke after the fifth time out.  We are going to buy a counter microwave (definitely NOT GE) and a real vent hood.
After UPS destroyed a Whirlpool unit last week, I opted to upgrade to this GE model.  The mistake I made was allowing UPS to handle the shipment again.  It is becoming apparent that UPS cannot handle anything that requires a hand truck without damaging it.  I would suggest that Amazon include a carrier option for shipping heavy items to possibly preclude damage in shipment.  For me, UPS would fall just below the kid down the street with his little red wagon.  As to the GE microwave, it arrived with two corners completely bashed in and assorted other small dents.  Not exactly a 30,000 foot drop, but enough to render it unusable.  If I'm ever able to once again enjoy receiving, installing and using an over-the-range microwave oven, I'll be sure to review its salient points.  Oh, and all potential buyers should be aware that if you purchase any item like this from a vender who does not have the caveat fulfilled by Amazon next to their name,and you have to return the item, you will simply have to wait for the item to arrive back at the vender and then rely on the vender to reimburse the cost.  Amazon cannot reimburse for it - you MUST wait for the vender.  Me?  I'm still waiting for my $500. Caveat Emptor!<br />September 13 - Update - Item arrived back at the vender today.  I'm still waiting for my $500.
the items was shipped & handled by UPS.  the microwave was bent in several places on the bottom. it was hard to tell if it was that way before packing or done during shipping.  box was damaged as well.  had we not been working<br />on a deadline for a house showing I would have sent it back for an exchange.  but no time.  it appears work just<br />fine and the dents don't show thanks to the shelf it was placed on.  I would expect a discount based on the<br />damaged product we had no choice but to keep.  I have photos if needed.
Replaced older Profile unit with this one. Some changes necessary for mounting, fortunately, the exhaust duct was in the same position as the older unit and installation took about 1 hour. Love the larger cavity size and rotating table. Helps to warm foods more evenly when using microwave. Works wonderfully as microwave and as convection oven. Saves us energy by allowing us to bake many foods without having to use our stove's larger gas oven and it works quickly. Only two &#34;observations&#34; we have are: 1. Touch Pad is very difficult to see in normal light. Attractive design, but near impossible to read as the gray typeface on black background is horrible choice. Not a big change for GE to make, surprised that engineering has not yet ordered such an important and easy revision. This may well be a safety and/or frustrating issue for some persons. See the labels I ended up making for the touch pad. (See Photo) 2. The volume of the beeper (at loudest) is barely audible.  Other than the above two &#34;cons&#34; we are very happy with the purchase. Good value!  Update May 2016 - First time we used the convection heater at 400 degrees, after about 5 minutes, the oven died - was as if a fuse had blown - Ge service arrived the following day to diagnose the problem, a blown thermostat. Estimate about 300.00 for parts and labor.  Considering this oven is only ablut 2.5 years old, that's far from what our years of GE products repair experience would dictate. SHAME on GE.
We used this brand new microwave for 3 weeks, and last night it caught fire while we were microwaving food.<br /><br />The food was not burnt, or overcooked. In fact it still had a minute more to go, when I noticed flames inside, at the top fan assembly region. We were able to put it out with a damp towel, but the entire top section was melted to reveal the electrical wiring inside.<br /><br />We googled to see if anyone had a similar problem and found the review posted just a week earlier hear on Amazon. This is clearly not some random freak accident, but a recurring problem with this microwave.<br /><br />If you have this microwave, do not leave it unattended while microwaving. If you are considering purchasing it, please please do not do it.
purchased 4/11 and have not had any issues. Love the turn off beep function. Filters are not at local home depot.
waiting on the call to ge to tell what happened<br /><br />just sad that my 3rd microwave work for about 2 years on average
We've had a SMH9187 (which search led me here) for 3 years and it's been great.<br /><br />Starting today whenever we close the door the microwave turns itself on.  I see other reports here and elsewhere of Samsung microwaves turning themselves on.  Seems like there should be a recall.<br /><br />UPDATE: They sent a tech out to replace the keypad and door latch mechanism.  Didn't solve it, but a few days later he came back out and replaced the door.  So far so good.
Add us to the long list of dissatisfied customers.  We already replaced the board once, and now, a year later, it went out again, suddenly, for no specific reason.  We heated up a bowl of chowmein for seven minutes. . . whoopee.  It's amazing that Samsung would not recall these microwaves or at least make the replacement part reasonably priced, but it's not worth buying the part, even to replace it yourself.  If you choose to purchase this microwave, do so with plans to throw it away in a year or so.<br /><br />Also, be aware that you have to specifically insist to the rep that you heard about the special one time repair that Samsung is supposedly doing, because they are not doing it on OUR models, only specific ones.
I must prequalify this review with the statement of fact that we have 4 major Samsung appliances or electronic devices in our home. I have always liked Samsung.<br /><br />Bought and installed this microwave in January of 2012. It just died two days ago. Totally dead... no functionality whatsoever. No lights, no keypad, nothing but dull, silent, insolent non-function. It isn't my circuit, as my oven (also Samsung) shares the outlet and is working fine.<br /><br />I called Samsung, and since it is just out of warranty, the service call would be $125 just to look at it + parts and labor. On top of that, the first call would be the diagnosis, and the technician would not have the parts. They would have to reschedule for that.<br /><br />Since I have a toddler in the house, not having a microwave is out of the question. So the risk of a $200-$250 repair bill + 2 weeks of being out of commission basically means I have to go buy a new *&#!$ microwave.<br /><br />Argh. So irritating. DO NOT BUY.
This microwave came with my apartment (mine is model JVM1540DM4WW, but it looks identical to this one), and it totally blew away my expectations of what a good microwave should be. It cooks quickly and evenly (everything takes about half as long as it did in my old microwave), the button options are good (I use the Express Cook buttons all the time), the bright and dim surface light options are nice, the shelf inside is pretty cool (even though I never cook that much at once), and I think it looks great in the kitchen (the rest of the kitchen is wonderful white and metal IKEAness). It's gotten a lot of use over the past year, and it's still performing just like new. I was surprised to see the negative reviews here, as I would absolutely buy another one of these.
Thin metal foil surface piece peeled off almost immediately.  Glued back on, but will probably happen again in other places.  Door is flimsy and bends easily so it requires a careful and firm slam to shut properly or the latch doesn't catch and it won't operate.  Same with closing after use, or light won't go out.  For the wear and tear, I imagine that the latch is what is going to finally break first.  This is the first truly disappointing major brand appliance that I have bought, and it was not the low end model.  We got GE Profile to match our other kitchen appliances. We will be needing a new dishwasher soon. This is enough to make us change brands.
Unit arrived looking like a truck had run over it! Ordered again thru one of the big box hardware chains and it also arrived beat to heck. They say third time is a charm. We'll see...
We just purchased a brand new home towards the end of April 2013 which had this microwave installed. There was no power in the house until we purchased it and we have already had the SE error code twice now. Even though the item was never used prior to April it is considered out of warranty because it was purchased in 2011. One of the reasons we picked this house was because of the brand new appliances. Samsung really blew it on this one. When we finally get the $$$ to replace this it will be with Frigidaire.  At least those still work in my home...
The microwave was dented when removed from packaging. Since the dent was in the back and didn't interfere with installation, I didn't send it back.
Similar to many other reviewers, we were happy with our purchase until the SE error appeared. The microwave lasted for 3 years without a problem, but suddenly tonight while using the stove, the microwave gave the error message. We tried to troubleshoot the problem, but nothing worked.<br /><br />I called Samsung to report the problem, and they are sending out someone to repair the control panel free of charge. Because of the negative reviews, they do have a special warranty on this part of the unit since it is such a common problem. Despite their helpful customer service, I would not purchase this Samsung microwave unless you eventually want to have to replace a faulty control panel.
Don't Buy!!!!  Our old version of the GE Profile caught fire while heating up something.  Fortunately our 8 yr. old son was in the room and was able to get my husband's attention before it escalated.  However, while trying to replace our microwave, we found that the only item we could replace it with was a GE microwave, either the Profile (which is the downgraded version of our former product) or a GE Monogram (the exact same unit as our old profile with a different name and much higher pricetag).  GE's response was to replace the item with the lower level model Profile (which we originally tried to replace it with but was falling apart after a couple of uses).  In order to get the exact same microwave (now called the Monogram) we had to pay an additional $335 for the upgrade.  Getting the microwave delivered in a timely and convenient fashion was another debacle.  Sadly, we are stuck using this GE product because our cabinets were built around the original, and nothing else will fit.
I chose this microwave to go along with the GE Cafe range I purchased at the same time. I read multiple poor reviews of this microwave online, but decided to risk it because I wanted the microwave to match the range. Bad choice! After owning the microwave just over a year, the magnetron konked out. Luckily, that particular part was covered under a 5-year warranty, but I still paid nearly $200 for labor. Now, just a couple of years later, the touchpad has expired and will need to be replaced. The service department tells me this repair will be a minimum of $250. (Touchpads start at $150.)<br /><br />I have never had so many problems with an appliance. The refrigerator I bought at the same time has never required service. The washer and dryer I bought nearly ten years earlier have only once required service. Yet this microwave has required two expensive repairs within just a few years of purchase. Before I bought this GE Cafe microwave, I had a cheap, unremarkable countertop model. I don't even remember the brand. But it was still working when I upgraded to the GE Cafe, so even though it was nearly 20 years old I was able to pass it on it to a neighbor whose child was starting college. At this point, I wish I'd kept the old one! I will never buy GE Cafe again.
My Samsung microwave worked fine until recently. It beeps!  It even starts beeping in the middle of the night.  I've unplugged and reset clock several times.  Now I have to unplug it after every use, and reset to use again.  Samsung online representative says if resetting doesn't work he would send a serviceman.  That would probably cost more than a new microwave.  I'll be searching for an new one.......definitely NOT a Samsung!
This microwave has many good features and fit great into our over-the-counter space in our kitchen. It was easy to install and has been very reliable. GE makes good products, but don't expect it to last forever. We replaced our old GE microwave that had lasted only about 7 years with this one. The primary reason I bought another GE Spacemaker was due to the size configuration that matched our old microwave. I did not want to have to replace my cabinets to have a different sized microwave!
We bought GE Cafe appliances for our remodel and have had nothing but problems.  Out of 4 separate kitchen appliances, 3 have had problems within 2 to 3 years of ownership.  The GE Cafe microwave suddenly stopped heating and we had to have a repairman come replace the magnetron and diode.  It worked a few weeks but stopped working again.  Then we found out it costs more to repair than to buy a new one.  We traced a workaround to the problem ourselves and found that the microwave works as long as we turn on the stove exhaust fan.  So now, every time we use our microwave, you need to turn on the exhaust fan.  Nice!  Numerous other reviews have complained about the keypad burning out as well, so if you buy, make sure to buy a long term multi-year warranty.  Our GE failures happened shortly after the 1 year warranty expired, and parts/labor for most repairs adds up to the purchase of a new appliance.
My husband and I purchased this on 5/27/13 .... the product has never worked.  I have been calling samsung for weeks and still the product doesn't work. Samsung has the worst customer service I have ever delt with. I am just trying to get a refund at this point.  I ask that they come and get it because,  I already paid to have it installed. ... I don't think I should have to pay to have taken out too. They said they will not send anyone and if I want a refund I have to send the plug and serial number . Again... just come and get it. Product is bad but the company is awful.  BBB rating for samsung appliances is an F wish I knew that before
I have a General Electric microwave model PEM31SM4SS manufactured November of 2011 in Maylasia and it is peeling on the interior across the rear top. I replaced the previous unit because of the same problem.  It also was relatively new at the time.  About two years. Painting seems to be the option offered for repair. Maybe General Electric should include a can of paint and brush with their microwave ovens. I will purchase a new one this week but not GE
We ordered this to replace the previous version. Style is slightly different. It does not seem as sturdy as the last one and it didn't last as long we would have expected a semi-premium appliance line to last. We use it as built in, which was fine for the first one, but this door is not conducive to built in configurations. The new black trim is okay. So far it works fine.
Many more features than advertised. Reading the manual is highly advised to get the most out of this product. It even has an automatic fan function for over a range use if there's too much heat buid up.
Purchased this about a month ago and am now on #3 which will be returned too.  The panel around the button to open the micro continues to come off.  Also, it takes at least two pushes to get the door open - with fairly forceful attempts.  It's really a shame because it works well otherwise and fits perfectly in our new kitchen.
We purchased this microwave in Oct 2011 and it stopped heating in June 2013.  The defective part is the magnetron.  The magnetron has a 5 year warranty but it will cost $90 and 3 days for GE to come to my home to confirm that is the problem.  Then I am told I can expect to pay another $250-$300 for the labor for them to come back out and replace the magnetron, no idea how long that will take.  Fighting with GE at the moment to have the part shipped to my local repair man who said he would replace for $99 total.  Warranty information does not say anything about it having to be replace by a GE tech.<br /><br />We bought all new GE appliances in October 2011 and so far we have had to have the fridge and now the microwave repaired in the first 2 years.  I guess we still have the range and dishwasher to look forward to fixing.<br />I thought GE was a good company but experience has cleared things up.
Started making a buzzing / arcing sound this morning.  Opened door, smelled burning electronics, unplugged for 30 minutes, tried again with nothing inside, same result.  Dead, going to recycling.  Getting a Panasonic Commercial Grade microwave instead - all residential microwaves seem to have reliability issues.
We bought all new Samsung appliance for our new home. The microwave and refrigerator have had to be repaired. The microwave started leaking microwaves and burned the inside lip of the unit and on the inside of the door, burning the paint. Samsung replaced the unit after it was seen by an appliance repairman and photos were uploaded to them. My replacement unit just died for no reason. I checked the outlet, breaker and plug - all fine. I have to wait another week before the appliance repairman can come out and tell me I'll have to wait another 2 weeks for a new unit to arrive. Then, I'll have to pay for it to be installed again.
Although I did not buy this microwave on line, I feel the need to warn potential buyers.  Caveat Emptor.<br />Unless you really like loud appliances, do not buy this one.  It sounds like a jet about to take off. I expected it to sound like a normal microwave. Not, a 747. One may think I am making a mountain out of a molehill, but I am hard of hearing and it is still loud to me.  I can only imagine what it sounds like to one with normal hearing.  'Nuff said.
I did not buy this here but from the store with the blue shirt associates; my model is SMH9187, which is similar to this one. This was installed by my contractor during a complete kitchen remodel and looked great above the Samsung range. After about 2 years, I got what all those 1-star raters got, a sudden incessant beeping that you could not reset or turn off, other than through unplugging the appliance. I tried turning off the main power, etc. but nothing worked; in fact, the error message and beeping became continuous.<br /><br />Friends of mine have had the same model for over three years and they have not had this problem. Why? Because I cook a lot of steamed food (rice, pasta, vegetables) and they do not. I'm sure the heat and steam from the range top has, as others have noted, damaged the circuit board. The keypad is over the right back burner, and even if I use any of the front burners, the steam will cover the entire front of the microwave; this happens even with the fan at full blast. There is always a film of condensation over the bottom half of the microwave.
The only thing I would chande is the push handle.  Sometimes it diesn't work the first time and it feels like it sticks.  Otherwise, a good product and good value.
We bought this microwave cause it matched the GE Profile Range we had purchased previously.  It looks great!<br />However, after less than 2 months of use, we had to replace the over the range light bulbs; which is apparently a common issue from the reviews on the ge website.  Worked fine for a year after that.  Last week we had an issue where the microwave started beeping to notify us that there was an issue with the keypad.  Turning the power saver off and on cleared the message, and we continued to use it uninterrupted for another week; until yesterday.  After heating lunch, I tried to warm a bottle of milk in this microwave.  After 30 seconds it was still cold, so I tried again.  At that point the microwave filled with smoke and the kitchen started to smell like something was burning.  We were told by the sales guy at the store that it is the magnatron that went (which is covered under warranty, but the labor is not; not to mention the $99 just to have the GE repair guy come to my house.  It sounds like something I wouldn't trust to be repaired.<br />I DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!
I have benn using this mivrowave for about a month now and it is great. It is easy  to use and powerful when cooking a microwave meal and the packing tell you to put in in for 3 min. and 30 sconds. your meal will come out nice and hot. this microwave is munch beatter then the lg one I had. any one looking for a good microwave should look in to this one. Don't belive the bad reviews. because I have had this microwave for a month now and I have Had no problems with it. I got my microwave from home depot.
I bought this GE microwave yesterday -- but not from Amazon, from Best Buy (only because I needed it right away). I unpacked the box and set it up. It would not work at all -- the display continually says Door (despite multiple clearing steps, resets, unplug/plug in, etc.). This display error message is not even addressed in the manual. I spent 30 minutes of my first day of ownership on the phone with GE support. The answer from them was obvious -- sorry, the door safety switch must not work properly. They gave all the usual excuses, sorry-sorry-sorry, please arrange for us to service it or repack it and drive it back to the store. Nice job GE -- an American name product and customer service at its finest, and you wonder why people buy alternative Asian name products. Best Buy should stop stocking GE products if this is GE's idea of quality control. Don't they check that products work when switched on before final packaging? I should not have to drive all the way back to the store. GE is wasting my time.<br /><br />Even more interesting -- I gave a negative one-star review of the microwave on the GE customer review section -- and their verification department that controls what is said on their website about their products, rejected my commentary. They have, however, allowed 14 reviews ranging from 3 to 5 stars. Here is the text of their rejection email to me:<br /><br />We appreciate you taking the time to write a review on JES0736SPSS; however, your review did not meet the guidelines for posting on our site.<br />We encourage you to revisit our guidelines and resubmit your review on JES0736SPSS<br /><br />I then read the GE guidelines, and NOTHING in my submission contravened the commentary guidelines -- it just happens to be a one star review from a very unhappy customer. GE does not like criticism. This experience has further reaching effects -- I am also looking at buying a new high end kitchen refrigerator -- GE was on my list, but no longer.
We purchased our Samsung MW (SMH9187W)three years ago.  It now has an SE error.  As others reported, Samsung told us to flip the breaker switch, etc., but a few minutes later, the same SE message came up, along with incessant beeping. Called Samsung back and we were passed around for about half an hour.  Called Lowe's (where we bought it) - said it would probably cost $150 to fix it and it should have lasted five years.  To us, not worth fixing.  Will NEVER buy another Samsung appliance.
Just installed the microwave and it has a lot of options. Just getting used to it. Unit did arrive with 2 minor dents to the exterior cabinet. Didn't return item because damage was hidden by install and didn't effect the operation of the unit. I was kind of wary that it would arrive damaged due to the weight of the item.I would recommend this item.
This Spacemaker microwave is 3/4&#34; deeper than in the specifications. This is the difference between fitting and not fitting in a 12&#34; deep cabinet.
I bought this LG microwave (LMV1680ST) as part of a full kitchen remodel a year ago. Upon first use, the microwave sparked and then made an unusually loud humming when on. Nothing heated. It broke on the first use. Home Depot, of course, said LG had to come out to deal with it. Since it was installed and not something I could easily take back to the store, I had to contact LG and schedule first a service consultation and THEN a service. What a pain. Now, less than a year later, the microwave is broken again. Since I bought it a few months before installation it's now out of warranty and LG wants to charge me $150 just to come out and inspect it. Don't buy it!! I threw away $200 on it and will just have to replace aNd pay for ANOTHER installation.
We never had the SE error but at 16 months the microwave, sparked, growled, then smoked like crazy out of the top.  It is now DOA and out of warranty.
I recently had a house built and the builder only uses GE appliances so I upgraded to the Cafe line.  I have no complaints with the function of the microwave but the cheap plastic handle bothers me. Mine is now bubbling and peeling. I have a work order in with GE to have this replaced.  I saw the earlier model, which this microwave replaced had complaints of the handle getting too hot.  I guess this is why they went to plastic.  I would rather use a towel,to open my microwave than have stainless paint flaking into my pots below.
This is an okay microwave if you have an extremely small kitchen.<br />CONS:<br />The outside of the microwave is nice and sleek; however, I know the door push button opener won't last because it already has to be pushed several times to get the microwave's door to open. The next issue I have is the cardboard piece that is screwed on the inside of the unit. (I really think this is a hazard, not a good idea, and not hygienic if food splatters on it. Next cons were how cheap the turntable holder is and how much extra time it takes to microwave foods. (Frozen Stauffers TV dinner took 9 minutes to cook!) Likewise, if you like to cook microwave popcorn I suggest you use the mini bags with this one...larger bags had too many kernels left or burned if I tried to get most of the kernels cooked.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Very quiet when operating.<br />Perfect size for my 6x8 sq ft galley  style kitchen.<br />Very sleek and the stainless steel accents are beautiful.<br />Has an interior light.<br />Loud alarm to warn you when cooking is complete.<br />It's quite heavy even though it is a compact size. So it won't fly across the counter if you press a button too hard.<br />Lots of preset functions and an easy to understand owner's manual.<br /><br />I thought GE was a great appliance maker...remembering my mother's GE appliances lasting 20+ years! This one I pray it last for the rest of this year! Also, this microwave is a lot cheaper on Wal-mart website $60 with free in-store shipping. Just a heads up if you still want to purchase one of these microwaves!
Have had numerous problems with this microwave since purchasing 3 years ago.  Makes horrible grinding noises periodically that last for a couple days then they go away for some unknown reason. Light bulb burns out quickly and location is so difficult to reach that I just gave up replacing it.  Convection bake and roast don't do as well as using a plain old convection toaster oven which is a whole lot less expensive. Can't defrost more than one minute without starting over.  It's quite expensive considering none of the special features work very well.
I've had this microwave for 2 weeks.  It works, for now.  But the interior light is already flickering while in use.  It's brand new and something is already wrong with it.  GE does not make quality microwaves and they do not stand by their products.  Betting it will only be a matter of time before it winds up in a landfill and I have buy new one.
I don't really use lots of fancy microwave features... we just set the power and the time and call it good.  This microwave works just great for that (it might also have great features... I just don't know them).<br /><br />Pros: Good price, easy to install, nice lights for stovetop, can be configured to vent or recirculate, looks good.<br /><br />Cons: The fan is less effective than a range hood (which is a given for any over-the-range microwave) and not as quiet as I would hope.<br /><br />Other thoughts: the beep is long, but not much louder than any other microwave... I see a lot of comments about it, but it hasn't bothered us.  Overall, we like this microwave and are happy with the purchase.
Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.<br />I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.
Worse product I've ever owned, I purchased the older model JVM17501MM on 06/29/2011 and it completely failed on 03/3132013, GE serviceman came to my home on 04/05/2013 and gave me a discounted (50% p&l) repair bill of $240.00. My consumer advocate at GE offered me a replacement of $250.00, funny since this item is selling all over for under $200.00. I will NEVER purchase any product from GE AGAIN. You should stay away. RUN away from this.
I have had the same problems as the others who wrote on here. I had a white over the range GE microwave that started having keypad problems. Since I was upgrading to stainless appliances, I bought this one and after 3 yrs. started having problems with the keypad again. Some of the buttons stopped working, then one night I woke up to a beeping sound and on the microwave display it said service immediately. I will not buy another GE appliance again, I would like to know what brand is a good one to go with.

I like the looks, the operation buttons on the bottom lends itself to a user friendly and a highly visible control panel. We have multiple Samsung products. All exceed our expectations of their products<br />There are NO other microwaves on the market with bottom eye level control buttons
Easy to install, user friendly instructions.  Came in good condition.  Manual very easy to understand and use micro/oven.  Cooks in 1/2 the time when using fast back.  Really good product.
I just installed this item. Be careful with the lag screws provided. They are tin like and do strip out no matter what and cannot be loosened or tightened once the head strips. They require a special flat nose phillips head but that did not help. Buy some quality mounting screws as $ 500.00+ is not enough for GE to include those, and I hope the rest of the unit is not as cheap as the mounting screws. Pollute the planet and make a extra trip to the hardware store. Second, I was leveling the microwave and son of a gun, the magnet on my level stuck to the inside of the unit, which is supposed to be stainless steel. I would still prefer whatever this stuff is to the plastic interior that comes with non-convection. The templates were perfect and put all the screws in the correct locations. You need to order the charcoal filter if you are using the recirculate rather than outside vented feature. To recirculate, you must unscrew 3 screws on top rear and rotate the fan housing 90 degrees before you install the unit. You also need to remove 2 screws on the upper front trim and slide in the filter then replace the trim. My 15 year old did both. You need to butt the top of the unit to the shelf above, or insert trim pieces around the top. If you don't, and let it hang even 1/2 inch, the unit can rise up if hit and fall off the shallow rear flanges that hold it to the back wall bracket and fall onto the new matching GE range. Our cabinets had a wierd from the 1960's lip on one side (I like old school stuff) and I needed to add the trim to prevent falling. The unit powered on and worked once we finished. Will update after a few months of use. I am a licensed electrical and general contractor, so I hope this helps in getting it ready to install. Took my son and I about an hour. The unit looks great in the kitchen. After months of research, it was between this and the Sharp, but this had more power and capacity, and there was not a Sharp in any showroom for QC comparison. Hope itwas the correct choice.
This microwave is now two years old and the door has too much play in it. It is loose and jiggles. The repairman can't fix it. It appears it needs a spacer of some sort. I would not recommend this product for that reason. If the door starts to do this, you have to get a new microwave.
I had it for about a year and a half now when the door is closed it just runs without producing heat.  I guess I could get it repaired but I'm wondering if it's worth it.  I may just buy a better quality microwave so I don't have to deal with it again.
I have been using this microwave for about a year. I will say the microwave works well as far as successfully heating items as a microwave should. Other than that, I find it to be an awkward design in the following ways:<br /><br />- The button for the light is directly under the &#34;Start&#34; button. If you hit the &#34;Start&#34; button, it automatically starts microwaving for 30 seconds. However, in a dimly-lit room, I often accidentally hit the &#34;Start&#34; button when I'm just trying to turn the light on. I can' tell you how many times I have started a 30-second microwave cycle on an empty microwave.<br />- Speaking of the lights there are two light bulbs underneath, which is fine. However, in the one year we've been using this microwave, the same bulb has burned out twice, while the other has yet to burn out at all. The first time, we had to scour the internet for a replacement bulb only to find that the specific wattage of the bulb that came in the microwave is pretty much unavailable. Anywhere. So we did some reading and learned to use a slightly lower wattage bulb. This took entirely too much research and hunting for what should have been a simple light bulb.<br />- The beeping at the end of the cooking (or timer) is quite obnoxious. It's 3 long, loud beeps, and, unlike every other microwave I've ever used, it does NOT stop when you open the microwave door! I have young children and often stand directly in front of the microwave, waiting for the timer to hit 1 second so I can stop it before it beeps so it doesn't wake up anyone sleeping/napping.<br />- There are lots of &#34;convenience&#34; setting (quick buttons), but I have never used a single one of them. Seems like a bit of a waste of space and features. It has a &#34;reheat&#34; button, but, unlike some other microwaves on the market, it is NOT a &#34;sensor&#34;/automatic reheat, so I'm not sure what the purpose of it is when you could just as easily enter the amount of time and hit start like normal.<br /><br />Overall, it looks nice enough and works as far as microwaving is concerned, but I personally think it comes with many flaws.

Thirty inch wide microwave ovens are a little hard to find. But that was the only thing I could use in the cabinetry in our Winnebago RV. It's much quieter than the one it replaced and seems to be more powerful too. We like it's added features oer the older unit we had. It decided to only run on high.
I went to open my microwave and the handle snapped ...yup snapped off into pieces!  Frigidaire will so graciously allow me to buy a new one as their way of standing behind their product....yes so we purchase an expensive microwave that is made so cheaply that you have to replace the handle that breaks apart and they get more money-yes that does sound right doesn't it?  But they stand behind their products....So frustrating!  Unless you have money to burn on replacing parts-DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Whirlpool,<br /><br />Check out these reviews!!  Obviously there is a serious defect.  Although it sounds like ours lasted longer than most (24 months).  Like others have written, we are not very heavy microwave users....the occassional reheating of coffee or defrosting of meat.  Seems ridiculous to me!
I purchased this microwave oven at a big box store when it was on sale, and received a better price than the amazon list price. I brought it home, removed the older microwave this was replacing and installed this new one, myself. (Installation was a bit more difficult than I expected it to be, but this had more to do with the shoddy installation of the unit it was replacing than any flaws in this unit, so I won't count that as a strike against this product.)<br /><br />In the few months that we have been using this unit, there are several things that I've noticed that have made me regret this purchase:<br /><br />1. The glass plate split in two after about two weeks of use. I have no idea why this occured. My wife stuck in a bowl of oatmeal to cook it and after about 30 seconds there was a loud bang and she turned it off to see what had happened. The glass plate was spilt into two pieces, nearly right down the middle. Weird. The replacement part cost me another $30. Not happy about this!<br /><br />2. The venting fan has a flap that opens to the duct inside the wall. The hinge on this flap is very weak and we can hear it flapping about on windy days. This seems very irregular, as the kitchen wall this unit is mounted on is an inside wall, not an exterior wall, and the ductwork goes up through the roof, not to the nearest exterior wall. I really don't think it should do this. The last unit did not do this, and it's a bit irritating to hear this flap rattling and squeaking around on windy days.<br /><br />3. This microwave positively will not cook a good bag of microwave popping corn. What's up with that? Isn't that a basic necessity of EVERY microwave? Put in a bag of popping corn and you either get 25% of it popped with wet, greasy kernels or 75% popped and it's all burned brown and stinky. The first few times I figured my wife was losing her mind and just counldn't figure out the new unit. Well, I have now tried four different brands of popping corn and got the same results with all brands. For a family that really enjoys microwave popping corn, this was a real bummer, and the number one reason I would never recommend this microwave to another person.<br /><br />4. In general terms, this microwave seems underpowered. It claims to have the same wattage cooking power as the model it replaced, but I'm not seeing it. Everything takes longer to cook with this unit. Sure, in microwave terms, you're only talking about 15% longer cook times which equal out to mere seconds or a few more minutes, so it's not a lot of extra time, but it's just worse than I expected. You always kind of assume that the new model will be better than the old, but that just wasn't the case, in this instance.<br /><br />5. OK, this one is just personal preference and not really a problem with the unit. (I probably should have inquired about this feature before purchasing this product.) I prefer microwaves that you just pop food into, press the seconds (or minutes) you want to cook something and then press start. On this unit, you need to press a button marked cook time before you start pressing any numbers. If you press any number at the start, the unit powers up and begins cooking the food by the number of minutes assigned to that number button on the number pad. Some people may be used to this types of microwave. I am not, so I prefer the aforementioned method of cooking food. I don't need auto-programmed cook times assigned to my numbers.<br /><br />Overall, generally displeased with this model and would NEVER recommend it to anyone.e results with all brands.

I purchased this unit to replace a GE spacemaker because it was the only one I could find that would fit in the cabinet space.  The new unit would not heat food when it arrived.  I am requesting an immediate replacement from the supplier.  I recall when GE had a good reputation in appliances, but now I have a low opinion of their quality.
Man I wish I'd read these reviews before buying this. I was at a local Big Box store and saw this on the shelf, decided to buy it on impulse.  After all, it's a GE and that's a great brand, right?<br />It was disappointing from the start. I don't use a microwave for much other that popcorn and heating freezer meals, and it couldn't even handle those. The popcorn setting burned the popcorn (my old, cheapo Sharp would always stop at just the right time.)  The meals were heated unevenly.<br />And now, after less than a month of very light use, the display flickers and it refuses to turn on.<br />After reading these reviews I decided it wasn't even worth repairing. I've junked it and bought a highly rated Panasonic from Amazon (along with a 3-year Square Trade warranty).<br />What a piece of junk!
Just like everyone else, I own this microwave. it died after 1yr of normal use right after the warranty ran out. When it worked there were no issues.
All purchase and shipping activities were fine. Microwave door on this model not well designed. It sticks and won't open or close properly if the unit is not perfectly level meaning installation under cabinet must be virtually perfect. Appliance repair person told me this is always a problem with this model. Wish I knew that before purchasing.
Googled by the model number and brought me here to see what a piece of crap that Whirlpool have made.<br />This is suppose be the upgraded version that my builder put in, yet with hardly any usage, this thing crap out on me.<br />I am the 35th customer that's pissed off of owning this crap.<br /><br />It is amazing that Whirpool have the balls to sell this microwave at all.<br /><br />Never ever going to get anything from Whirpool ever again.
This microwave worked fine while it lasted, about 2 years.  It looks fine and wasn't too loud when the fan was on, but the fact that it didn't last any longer makes the features irrelevant.  The price certainly was no better than comparable microwaves with much better longevity.  I would not recommend this product.
This thing broke down in the same manner as all the other reviewers described. Samsung should be ashamed, this is a pretty obvious design flaw. I will be staying away from ALL samsung products from now on.
I bought this for myself about 2 years age and liked it so much that I bought the same one for my sister. I like it very much. Its a perfect size, easy to use, has a button for baking potatoes and other items. I recommend it very highly.
Bought this microwave in June 2012 for a kitchen remodel. Its barley 5 months old and although I have not experienced the dreaded 5E error, the unit has already started acting funny. The last few days the unit will loose the time and display please set time. This AM while making oat meal for my daughter, I opened the unit and it was dead. No light like it was unplugged. Closed and the display listed all 0's across. Opened door again no light. After a few times the light went on and unit was operational. Subsequently  I did do the stop/enter key diagnostic test and all it showed me was 1816s (model) and 110512A, which I assume means 1105watts 12amps? I hope this is not a precursor to the 5E error? Thinking the seller acquired refurbished units from another party (i.e.Samsung, Lowes?) and has been pawning them off as new here. I am going to check to see if my appliance repair plan that I pay for from my utility company will covers microwaves, if not new unit for me.
Like other reviewers this is the 3rd GE Spacemaker microwave I have owned.  We also built the space to fit this model and it is difficult to find a replacement.  I kept hoping with each new model that GE had corrected the problem.  The paint is peeling of the ceiling of my current microwave less than 2 years later. I worry that the paint will get in the food or worse that there may be a danger at using it.
I bought this microwave about a year ago.  The exterior is attractive, and it fit well into the space I had for it.  However, after just one year of relatively infrequent use, the top of the cavity is flaking, with big chunks of paint now gone. I've had to throw away things I've cooked because there were flecks of paint falling from the top into my dish. It is ridiculous to have to replace a new and otherwise functional appliance. The replacement will not be a GE.
This was to replace a bad microwave in one of our condo's kitchen - it fit perfectly and looks good. Thank You
Looks and works great so far... the vent is really nice and powerful too... a bit loud when you set it at the highest but sure does work
I purchased this along with 3 other Gallery appliances. If I had read these reviews, I may have purchased a non-matching microwave.  All seem to work okay, but this microwave has an overall stupid factor that just doesn't make sense.  You can silence the beeping (which is VERY ANNOYING), but it also silences everything else.  I had a $200 Goldstar with better features such as a timed nightlight.  I hope Frigidaire people read this.
Received it and installed it. The fan went on and the fan blew but it did not heat.  It took me two months to finally get a repair person to come out but he guessed and ordered the wrong part (magnitron). It turned out to be something else, I can't remember what, so they have to order that. I am still waiting.  Fortunately my old microwave (Amana) still works out in the garage or I would be really frustrated. The repair person told me that GE has the most problems even though all the brands use the same components, from Korea.  Must be something about the GE specs together that blows things up.  I'll be staying clear of GE products from now on.
Microwave does it's job but door started sagging within first 30 days and the unit quit working within a year.
This is the second microwave and just like the first one it lasted less then a year. The magnetron fried, we bought a new one, it fried again, we fixed it and it happened a 3rd time. I will not buy another whirlpool product!
The push latch for the door is very tricky.  Sometimes it opens the door at once.  Mostly it takes repeated efforts.
This is the only microwave made that fits into my pre-constructed custom cabinet space. My first one lasted 8 years.  When it wouldn't turn off, I ordered a new one.  The first one sent to me would not turn on.  Seems like something was wrong with the key pad. GE's fault,not the distributor or Amazon.  Called Amazon and they credited me immediately and charged /sent me a new one the next day which worked perfectly.  I just returned the first one in the original box with the scanner label they sent.
We bought this mwo 20 months ago and were satisfied until the magnetron failed at 20 months, which is unacceptable!  Since the magnetron has a 10-yr warranty, we checked for local authorized repairmen, but there  were none close enough to make the repair worthwhile, since we have to pay for labor.  Check this out before you buy.
We read all the negative reviews but decided to take a chance anyway as this was the only size microwave that fit the cabinet space we had. Big mistake. 1yr 2months after we bought it the magnetrom(?) stopped working - the microwave no longer heats anything. Called for service and since labor is out of warranty it would cost us $180 to get it fixed. Even before that some of the exterior plastic pieces had actually come off and we had just taped it back on.<br />Well, we're NOT buying another one of these nor getting it fixed. We've chosen to re-do the cabinet because in the long run it will be cheaper than to keep buying a poorly built product that lasts just past its 1 yr warranty. Will be staying away from GE products as well.
This microwave is garbage.  We have had many problems with it, fought with the warrenty center, they finally replaced it and it is not working again. Microwave ovens should last longer than just a couple years.  Whirlpool you need to do something about this.  You know this isnt just a random problem.  You have produced a inferior product and you need to do something about it.  This microwave costs $1000.00.  This isnt a walmart throw away item.  YOU NEED TO RECALL THIS ITEM!
There is definitely a manufacturing flaw with this microwave that Whirlpool refuses to admit! When this microwave was under warranty in the first year, we had if fixed FOUR times for the same problem. Luckily we didn't have to pay for those repairs because the warranty covered it. While it was still under warranty, we tried to talk to the company and let them know about the four repairs for the SAME thing noting that it must be a problem with how the product was made. All they did was try to get us to buy the extended warranty.<br /><br />So, 8 months after we bought this $500 microwave, we had to buy a new one! I truly believe that Whirlpool knows there is a defect with this microwave but refuses to stand behind their product.
So far so good. Replaced a Samsung and the existing bracket worked. Much quieter than the one replaced. My wife loves the<br />melt/soften function.
I bought this microwave August 2012. It died November. The operator's manual stated that, to avoid trip charges, I should take it GE Customer Care services and pick it up following service. Called up 1-800-GECARES, as given in the manual, to inquire on where to take it for service. There was no option to do that. They want to make a service call and charge $80 trip fee.<br /><br />Stay away from GE Products. They're defective and service is poor.
I have to echo previous reviews. We got this microwave because it fit in with our stainless steel appliances after we redid our kitchen. It's actually a great microwave, I think, it looks great and the settings/features are really nice. But, a little bit after the 1-year warranty ran out, part of the keypad became defective--the numbers. Some of the other buttons worked so we could still partly use it while we diddled around before finally calling the repair technician. He came out, took one look at it and told us that it would be more expensive to repair it than to just buy a new one. Called and complained to GE, and we were able to score a GE credit worth almost the price of another microwave. We had specific space/look criteria, so we had to end up buying the same one. It's only a matter of time before it goes, too.<br /><br />To add another note, my college apartment has the exact same microwave, only in white instead of stainless steel. The keypad also broke one day, and when I called to get it fixed they came out the next day and replaced the whole thing--apparently it happens so often they have a few of them just sitting around as replacements.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars because, while it is prone to breaking, it is at least a really functional/attractive microwave and we didn't have to pay very much on a replacement. If you only need a microwave for 1 year or less, it's a good buy. Any longer, which will be most people, find a different brand.
I have only had this installed for several days and have not used all functions, but so far it seems like a good machine.
I've been trying to get through to Whirlpool about this microwave, having the same issues as everyone else. I don't ever remembering seeing a product with all 1 star reviews; I don't know if it's even worth getting this fixed through warranty after reading all these. I won't be buying any Whirlpool from here on including any other brand names they use.
This microwave was selected during a KB HOME build for our new home over 2 years ago (Summer 2010).  The microwave indicated that it was manufactured in April 2010.  Low and behold the microwave would start shutting down by itself when I hit start beginning about June 2012.  A few days ago it just stopped working completely.  No pop, no fizzle, no crackle - it just wouldn't heat up anything.  Whirlpool dispatched a 3rd-party repair person and he stated that the magnetron was bad (or dead?).  He was fairly certain it was a recall item.  The repair person estimated that, absent a recall, it would cost $450 to fix. The service appointment itself was $89.  The following day, the repair service left a voice-mail stating that it was not a recall item, but that I should verify it with Whirlpool .<br /><br />I contacted Whirlpool (1-800-253-1301) and the customer service rep stated that it wasn't their problem once the standard 12-month warranty had elapsed.  The rep said there was no recall for the magnetron.  I escalated the matter to a supervisor.  All the supervisor did was reiterate that Whirlpool wasn't going to do anything past the 12-months.  The supervisor then offered to sell me one of four new microwaves at a VIP rate.  Of course the rate was not VIP at all once you added the deliver ($70) and the installation ($45) charges (so for being screwed over, I was a VIP?).  It goes without saying that I didn't take her up on the offer(s).<br /><br />Needless to say, I was very upset and immediately Google'd the model number in the hope of finding out more info on the problem and perhaps locating a cheaper replacement for the microwave.  And that, my friends, is how I ended up here on Amazon and saw that 29 other reviewers before me also had issues with this particular microwave.  I got a certified lemon.<br /><br />What are my options at this point?  A class action lawsuit?  A complaint to the state Attorney General's office? I don't know. What I do know is that Whirlpool is aware of the problem and could not care less.  I'm out of $600 (or more) and  I'm left reheating stuff in the oven now.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE.
Same story as the others here. Poor product, poor service. The dreaded -se- code after 20 months.  Debating smashing it on YouTube once I get a new microwave. Don't buy this rubbish!
We purchased ours from a local store in on order to have it installed. They DON'T install the charcoal filter! GRrrr.... The reason I was so disappointed is because I'd read it was a bugger to install, as it was the wrong size. I was appalled to be told that they never install the filters, even if purchased from that store (bought mine on Amazon for $30 cheaper than the chain!). Was told I have to take the front panel off!!  IF the directions are followed carefully, it's very simple. It is designed to tilt, not stand straight inside the vent opening, as one would think. I tell YOU all this to say, laugh at the installation guys, get a screwdriver, and tilt the filter in, and pat yourself on the back. Who needs them anyway? Oh, yeah...to lift and drill and screw the thing in. It's heavy! Now, as for performance, more to come later!<br /><br />One last thing, all the reading I did on this led me to believe the vent was a powered door that opened, and that is a part that often breaks on OTR microwaves. This does NOT have a powered vent door, it just recirculates. That was the only reason I purchased a warranty. Oh well, now YOU know!
We loved the small size & appearance.  Unfortunately, it worked for the first 3 days, so we through away the box.  Before the week was over, it wouldn't heat anything no matter how long we set the timer for, or what power setting we used.  Without the box, it can't be returned. A complete waste of money.  DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE, or if you feel like gambling, at least SAVE THE BOX!
Wish I had checked Amazon before buying. As of today, not one review higher than 2 stars. I have to agree. Ours just crapped out shortly after the one-year warranty. Anyway,with most warranties, it's simpler to just buy a replacement rather than go through the hassle and expense of repair. It wouldn't be so bad if this was a countertop model, but when you have to install something, you don't want to drag it out and leave a gaping hole in your kitchen. I will avoid ANY Frigidaire appliance from now on.
Like most other reviews here, I can confirm that this microwave died quickly. After 2 weeks the handle broke off in my wifes hand. After 10 months we had a loose connection internally that needed to be repaired, and now after 16 months, the unit is completely dead. Fuses all check out fine. Thermal fuse, Thermocouple and power check out fine. All 120 volts. Either the control board for the keypad is dead, or the magnatron, HV capacitor or diode is shot. Either way, we are NOT repairing the unit again. It will be replaced with a commercial microwave and I will build a shelf for it to sit on over the top of our range. I will mount an exhaust fan below that and duct it all outside.<br /><br />This microwave has completely turned me off from the Samsung brand (which all of our appliances are). Too bad it's just cheap construction that ruins these new microwaves. They are all built with cheap components, unless you buy a commercial/industrial unit.<br /><br />Look at the Panasonic Pro series NE-1054, Vollrath 40830, Turbo Air TMW-1100M, or Amana RMS-10D for quality at a decent price. I wish they made a commercial over the range style, but I have yet to find one.
Very attractive and functional microwave, that was easy to install as a replacement for a GE microwave that no longer worked.
This microwave was pre installed by KB HOME when I purchased the house. It came with extended warranty for 18 months and the microwave died just after 20 month of use. I don't know how whirlpool manage to tune this microwave just to work for the warranty period.<br /><br />Anyway now I end up with an expensive exhaust :(<br /><br />Take it from all the reviewers here !!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!
Purchased this microwave from Lowes in August 2011.  The microwave stopped heating four days ago...fifteen months from installation to failure.  Contacted Samsung for repair service, and was directed to an authorized service provider in my area who qouted me a $95 charge just to come to the house...parts and labor would be additional.  What's interesting is that the microwave didn't last long enough for me to experience the SE code problem that virtually everyone else has mentioned.  So, do I pay to have the unit repaired only to then have the SE code problem pop-up, or do I just go get a different oven???  Hmmmm...I think I'll get a new oven...and not a Samsung.
This is an excellent product. It has variable intensity settings and just enough features to be easy to use. Its not only nice looking, but Consumer Reports rates it as one of the best. The stainless steal body makes it easy to clean and it fits any Kitchen decor.
Had this microwave for only 18 month and the door latching spring broke.  Now I can't close the door, and nothing works.
This microwave SUCKS and so does the seller!!!! I purchased this microwave in April because I was remodeling my kitchen and was upgrading to this better quality stainless steel over the range microwave.  Well how I said I purchased it in April, but didn't install it until the beginning of August.  The delivery was fast, but when I reccieved it, two of the back corners were dented, but I decided to install it anyways because it was in the back anyways and nobody would ever see it.  It is now October and it has gone out on me.  I was about to warm up my dinner when I pressed start and BOOM it went out.  It turned off just like that.  It never turned back on. I am really dissapointed becasue I thought I had purchased a good quality product.  I contacted the seller and he said to call Samsung and they would cover it since its still under warranty.  Well it is under warranty, but the thing is it turns out this is a refurbished unit when the seller says he purchased it new from Lowes.  He's a liar becasue Lowes does NOT sell refurbished units.  So now I'm out a couple hundred $$$ and now I have to purchase a new one.  People please listen to the reviews and don't buy this microwave, whether it's her or some other place.  Save yourselves time, money, and dissapointment.  Also, do NOT buy from this seller he is sooo unproffesional and NOT helpfull. I only give it one star because I have to give it a 1-5 or else I would give it a 0.
This was the Consumer Reports recommended one, and we bought one based on that, only to have it fail within 24 months.  I won't be wasting money on repairing this, and certainly won't be buying a Samsung brand.
I purchased this product because our last Spacesaver finally bit the dust after almost 20 years.  Not the same quality product as previously produced. Door sticks , popcorn button doesn't always spin turntable as indicated in manual.
Evidently this is a common problem with Samsung microwaves: the keypad shorted out after less than two years of use, resulting in the microwave, stove light, and exhaust fan becoming inoperable.  The cost of repair- for labor only- would have been $150 for an item that originally cost $220.  After several calls to Samsung's Executive Customer Relations department, I was curtly informed that Samsung is unwilling to take ANY action to remedy this situation.  My only option at this point is to replace the microwave - NOT with a Samsung product- as I have no way of running the exhaust fan in my newly-remodeled kitchen. And even worse, due to some new environmental law, I will have to PAY to dispose of this worthless piece of junk.<br /><br />Samsung does not stand behind the products they sell. Samsung has atrocious customer service.  Across the board their products get poor reviews, yet they are unwilling to take any action to correct the problem and maintain good customer relations. They appear to operate under the assumption that  for every dissatisfied customer, there are thousands more willing to buy their shoddy crap. This attitude is unacceptable, especially in these tough economic times.<br /><br /> I will NEVER buy ANY Samsung product, EVER!  Save yourself the aggravation:  DO NOT BUY!
This microwave fits perfectly with our GE Cafe gas range, which is why we bought it. It's quite heavy - apparently due to the built-in convection oven. Disappointing is the plastic handle, which look like stainless steel, but isn't.  I expect more from an $800 appliance.  Also, if you plan to vent this into the kitchen, make sure you have a cabinet over the microwave that is not more than 13 inches deep.  The microwave vents are on top of the front of the microwave and blow straight up.  Other microwaves have vents that fold open, which is a really cool idea. Again, the GE Cafe falls short here.  Hence, only three stars for now.  I will update this as we use it more.
Everything is great!!! Just a warning!!!! Double check the template used for the upper cabinet. Actually check it against the unit. In my case I replaced an older Maytag, so I had two existing holes in my cabinet. Then added two more because of the template only to fine that they do not line up!!!!!! I superimposed the template over the unit and sure enough the holes did not line up!!! So I did not make a mistake!!!! The Template was off. No real big deal but now I have six holes.<br /><br />Double check the holes!!! Unit is great!! Previous unit did not vent out of the house. This one I installed a vent to the outside through the back and it has a really powerful motor. This Microwave gives you three options,Vent back,vent from the top or recirculate. I do not reccomend recirculating!!!! If you can vent this unit or any unit always vent!!!! I had some major issues venting this unit because of structural issues, like wires that I had to reroute etc but I knew that when it was over I would be smiling and I am!!!! For the price this unit works as good as any for much more money and the VENT is the Greatest!!!!!
I am very satified with this microwave although I was surprised when I saw two small dents on the door.  This of course does not in anyway hamper the workings. I would recommend this product for its efficiency.
Bought GE's 2006 model. It became a bread box/clock four days ago (about 9/15/2012). Scheduled one of their authorized repair men. Took him 5 minutes to determine that the only problem was that the microwave generator thingy quit. The display, oven light and turntable are as good as new, but the micro doesn't heat anything. Cost of the part = $400. The good news is that the $75 house call will be offset by getting a coupon redeemable for $100 if I buy another GE Profile over-the-range. My cheap, little, off brand counter top microwave just won't quit working. I'm not certain what to do.<br /><br />One last thing, the halogen surface light quit about six weeks after original purchase. You have to stand on your head, and use a special backhanded screw driver to replace the bulbs. Very convenient feature, but maybe I should have paid an authorized repair tech to replace the bulbs.
Keypad error SE.  $185 to repair.  I'm getting a new microwave, but can't seem to find a good review on any of them from someone who had it more than 1 year.
After about 18 months of working beautifully, we also got that SE error. Called an authorized dealer and between the cost of a service call, the price of labor and the price of the new keypad, it will cost $200 to fix.  No way!!  I will be purchasing a new microwave and it will most definitely NOT be a Samsung!! Time to issue a recall like they do with cars...they know who has registered this product. We should all be given replacement keyboards free of charge. We need lemon laws for appliances. I urge you to stay away from this one.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />I spoke with the authorized service provider and he suggested I contact Samsung directly (1-800-726-7864). I spoke with customer service and then was transferred to Executive Customer Relations. They first offered me a free replacement part but told me I would have to pay for the service call and any labor charges. I told her that was not acceptable as that would still cost me $135. She put me on hold again and came back telling me she could give me as a courtesy a ONE TIME ONLY warranty extension. She made it clear it would not ever be repeated. So, at least now I will have the repair done at no cost to me. Hopefully the new part will last longer than the original.  I suggest you try giving them a call if you are one of the many with this problem.
It's a decent microwave, no better or worse than others I've had over the last 30 years in terms of cooking.<br /><br />If it looks nice in your kitchen and matches your other appliances, it might be worth considering.<br /><br />However, please know that this is the first time I've ever had a microwave that wont' let me set a timer while cooking.  Nor will it let you cook food in it while a timer is running.
This product initially worked very well.  Within a few months, we found that the microwave would come on all by itself.  It totally quite working in about 1.5 years.  I have read many complaints just like this one.  It should have been recalled by the manufacturer.  I will never buy this brand again.
RECALL NEEDED - THIS PROBLEM HAS EXISTED FOR OVER 8 YEARS IN THE SAME MODEL MICROWAVE FROM G.E. IT IS NOT SAFE. ONCE THE WHITE COATING PEELS AWAY AND METAL IS EXPOSED THE UNIT WILL SPARK AND CAN CAUSE A KITCHEN FIRE.    The white coating is bubbling and peeling off of the inner top surface of my microwave. It was manufactured in March 2011 and installed in June 2011. Just over a year ago. The current unit was a replacement for the exact same built-in unit that also was just over a year old and experiencing the same problem. If you purchase one of these units, be sure to purchase an extended warranty.    If you read the comments at the GE community forum you will see that this problem has existed for years. Same product, same model number, same problem over and over. But GE has done nothing to correct it. Read the details at this link:  [...]    Although, it is a useful unit otherwise - lots of great features. But once the coating starts bubbling and peeling you cannot safely use it. Total hazard. Additionally, unless this unit is installed over a range users are probably operating the unit without knowing it is in an unsafe condition because they cannot see the coating peeling away on the top inner surface.    WHY HAS GE NOT RECALLED THIS PRODUCT?
We have had this microwave for just over a year.  One month after warranty we got an SE error code.  In doing some research we found over 200 complaints about it on the Samsung web site.  With a lot of complaining we got them to authorize a free service call.
I bought this microwave 18 months ago from Sears and it looked good and worked just fine until the SE error message came up a week ago. Then the keypad stopped working. We tried plugging and unplugging, and I have tried all of the fixes found online but to no avail. I am now planning to replace it with a quality product. so much for buying a good looking product that reviewers say works well. I want my appliances to last more than a year and half.
This oven made it about a year before the interior paint started peeling off.  Customer service was not helpful.  This oven cost us at least twice what comparable ovens cost.  We bought it because it fit the space we had available.  Never again.
I spent several thousand dollars on Samsung appliances as part of a kitchen remodel in Oct11.  In May I noticed that when I opened the door of the microwave it appeared to have a short (a bright light flashed then went out).  It still heated but as I thought it might be a fire hazard I contacted Samsung.  They set me up with a service repair company that had a poor rating on Angie's list.  A guy came out, dismantled it and said a key part needed to be replaced (he noted 'switches' on the service order dated May 15th).  He said it would take 3-5 days so he came back a week later, without the part, saying he just need to tighten some wires.  It worked for a few weeks, then started to heat only intermittently.  Called the service company again, and a guy came out and jiggled the door, saying there was a problem with the switches, but that they didn't need to be replaced.  It worked again for a few weeks, where I had to keep jiggling the door, and finally stopped heating altogether.  Now, knowing that there was a problem with the switches, I expected the guy to arrive with the needed part.  He came but again, no part, saying he just wanted to confirm it was the switches and that the part had already been ordered.  After not hearing anything for a few weeks, I called back and was told that 'Sharp parts were backordered'.  When I told her it was a Samsung, she didn't look up my order but just said she would look into it and call me back.  After not hearing anything again, I called back and she said the same thing (Sharp is back-ordered, correction it's Samsung)and said she would call me back.  Again didn't hear back so called Samsung.  The escalation department reviewed the situation and I was put in for an exchange because the process had gone on so long.  She said I would get a call from someone who would review options with me (when I asked what the options would be she didn't know--why is that?).  Instead, I got a call from Samsung a week later saying that the servicecompany had miraculously received the part and they wanted to schedule a service call.  I told her I had been put in for an exchange and she insisted that I again deal with this disreputable service company.  I refused, and since I didn't have the Transaction # she said she would call me back today.  She didn't call this morning when she said she would so I called Samsung.  Just got off the phone with Samsung, who refuses to replace my microwave.  It just seems to be a game of stringing customers along with vague and misleading promises.  The only 2 service companies they have for this area have F ratings on Angie's list.<br />I had a similar situation occur with my 1 month old stove back in December, which broke on Xmas Eve.  After 3 months of fighting with Samsung Best Buy finally felt sorry for me and gave me a new stove.<br />After spending thousands of dollars on Samsung appliances I expected more from Samsung.<br />I would stay away from Samsung or if you do purchase an appliance from them, get an independent warranty.  Customer service is a problem area for them.
Please, please do not buy this microwave. After just a few months it stopped heating intermittently. Then it started tripping our breaker. It only does this occasionally. I have had Samsung repair personnel out twice and they can't fix it. They now say I must have a faulty breaker. Well, we had a Kenmore microwave in the same exact spot for 9 years and it never once tripped the breaker. They have no explanation as to why it doesn't heat. They haven't fixed it, I'm worried the electrical system is faulty, and therefore a fire hazard and Samsung refuses to replace it.  The problems occur sporadically and as a repairman hasn't actually seen it malfunction they don't believe me. Do not buy this OR ANY SAMSUNG PRODUCT!!<br />The total lack of concern for their customer is shocking. My husband and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with some lackey from customer service named Landry H. and all he did was spend the entire time telling us he couldn't help us unless we agreed to a THIRD service call to see if they could catch it not working. He refused to transfer us to anyone else, or offer us any alternatives, no matter how many different things we suggested.  I will never buy a SAMSUNG product again, and to anyone reading this review, for your own sanity.....RUN.
It is a very compact microwave and will fit well in a tight space.  The power is quite low and heat things very slowly, sometimes painfully slow. if you have a small kitchen, this will work OK, but be prepared to put up with slow heating and not so easy to use controls.
This PEM31SMSS GE Profile Spacemaker unit intermittently powers off while cooking. There seems to be a power supply issue. If you unplug for a few seconds and plug back in (I have to reset the clock) it will work again until it powers off randomly again. Not sure what is up.  I have contacted the Amazon seller and am awaiting instructions for returning and getting a new unit. I have a old (8+ yr old) full size GE Profile Spacemaker 2 that has never had any issue which I will continue to use until I get a replacement unit.
We purchased our Samsung over the range microwave 14 months ago.  We started getting the 5e but it would clear up overnight.  Then it got so none of the keyboard would not work. I guess we'll have to buy a new microwave but it definitely won't be a Samsung.
This is my first LG microwave and it will be my last!  Glass plate is NOT as heat resistant and breaks easily while cooking food.  Customer service was even less helpful.  Buyer beware!!!!
If this GE Profile Microwave is built like its cousin, the PVM1870, beware of the worst quality control and internal components possible.  In the two years we have owned a PVM1870 Profile, it has had 6 service calls and about every electronic part but the magnetron has been replaced, several components have been replaced TWICE.  I can accept and understand an electronic component failing, but not that many with some replaced twice -- does NOT speak well of either quality internal components, quality internal engineering or quality control.  The only reason that I gave it one star is that a zero star rating is not possible.<br /><br />Addendum:<br />The motor/power supply burned up AGAIN -- plus another service call for the vent door not opening any longer.  Now we are up to 8 service calls on the extended warranty.  This GE product is an ABSOLUTE PIECE OF JUNK and the last GE product we will ever own.  BTW -- the service personnel are excellent and know their jobs -- it is strictly the lack of build quality and quality control for this GE product that has caused so many failures.  It does not deserve ANY stars in the rating.
This was a reeplacement purchase.  Our previous unit had no issues and was locally purchased.  The door was accidentally damaged and could not be easily repaired.  Needed exact replacement for previously purchased trim kit although product reviews concerning.  Within 2 weeks the electronic key board routinely malfunctioned.  Often requires multiple attempts to start.  contacted seller who defered back to GE.  Not the kind of service I expected nor previously experienced with an amazon vendor.  My recommendation is to avoid both (vendor and product)if possible.
I was in a hurry to purchase a microwave after mine had died.  I didn't spend any time researching as I normally do and made an on the spot decision at the store.  That turned in to a huge waste of time.  I bought the microwave, brought it home and installed it only to find that it was a lemon.  The electronics all worked, however, when plugging it in, the fan would kick on while the tray rotated as if the heat sensor was bad.  As a result, the unit did not function.<br /><br />I should have known after reading a few mediocre reviews while I was in the store to stay away.  My desire to get it done outweighed common sense.<br /><br />The Microwave is in the box being returned today and I'll have to do it again and likely drill new holes.  I don't plan on exchanging for the same model.
I bought this less than three years ago.  I seldom use it to heat food.  I only used it for light, fan and timer.  Now, it keeps on beeping and the technician said it will cost me $160 to $200 to repair it.
We got ours three years ago when we redid our appliances and it has been the workhorse of my kitchen.  I cook everything in my microwave and it's so smart it knows how to cook, defrost or reheat everything!  It has been durable and dependable, it's large and versatile.  I have only had to replace a plate (I'm a klutz) and the handle (20-yr-old doesn't know his own strength).  If you want the best microwave ever, get it!
We bought this microwave in the summer of 2011. It did not heat even when first installed. Whirlpool sent a repairman who fixed it, only after three months of work and making several orders for different parts. Six months later, it stopped heating again. We have asked for a replacement but Whirlpool will only send the repairman again. They will not replace the product even though we have been unable to use it less than half the time we have owned it. This product is a lemon and not supported by the manufacturer. I have read many other reviews that indicate the same thing. We will never buy Whirlpool or any other brand made by this company again! We desire to buy American, but not at the cost of buying inferior products from a company with lousy customer service!
We bought this Frigidiare microwave in the hopes of getting a solid over the range microwave to use.  Before it was two years old it began to smoke and sputter as it began to burn up.  We killed the power and shut it down.  We contacted Frigidaire and were told it was out of warranty.  We told them we were reporting a safety hazard that they should be aware of.  We were told that it was impossible for the microwave to do what ours had done.  No support, rejection of safety hazard report, no offer of repair or replacement.<br /><br />We think you will regret buying this product.  We do.  Complete waste of money.
I had an older GE microwave above my range that died after about 8 years. When looking for a replacement I decided to go for another similar GE in order to swap it out easily, figuring it would use similar hardware. That was my first mistake.<br /><br />There's a steel plate used to mount the oven on the wall plus three big screws that go in from the cabinet on top. Not only is the plate different (requiring removal of old & installation of the new), not only are the anchor points in different places (requiring new holes), but they're placed just marginally off the old anchor points. Meaning that the integrity of the wood where you need to drill is compromised from the old screw holes. It required me to install a whole new shelf in the upper cabinet as well as trying my best to fill the old stud holes with wood filler and hoping it would be strong enough when I re-drilled.<br /><br />Here's the kicker... the installation hardware comes with butterfly screws as well as two thick wood screws for mounting to the wall studs. Unfortunately, those two wood screws are made of very cheap & weak metal. I pre-drilled guide holes as per the instructions, but when it came to screwing the screws in- the heads twisted right off on both of them (and I was extra careful with the second one after the first one broke).  The screws were already 3/4 of the way in, leaving me with no way to remove them and blocking the ability to try again in the same spot (a spot required for proper installation).  The oven isn't light, the installation requires heavy duty hardware, why ship the microwave with such crappy screws?<br /><br />Lessons:<br /><br />Buy your own mounting hardware.<br />When it comes to buying a replacement appliance, there's no value in nepotism.
I have had this microwave less than 2 years and I too am getting the SE error code.  It is $99 just for someone to look at it!  You can't press any of the buttons.  This obviously is a manufacturer issue if there are so many complaints about it.  Now I have to spend another $300 on a new microwave not Samsung.
I brought a samsung SMH9187ST back Nov. 2010, which is the same exact microwave as the SMH 1816S with the exaact same features listed. On June 14, 2011, I had a technician come to my home to repair this unit. This unit was under warranty at the time. On May 6,2012, samsung microwave display SE on the screen. Call samsung office and they referred me to a service tech. also, stating the unit was not under warranty regardless of the last repair date. I call the service tech. office somewhere in Norcross,GA.to find out what it would cost for a visit to my home. The office employee(not the tech.) stated the tech. visit for my area would be $140.00 to look at and replace the unit part which would cost $75.00. Total cost $215.00 The employee that was not a tech. quoted me the cause of my problem and the part that cause the problem without some even looking at the unit. Sounds like the repair company already have a lot of information without every touching or looking at this samsung microwave unit. This appears to be an on going problem with this unit even though the on thing that has change is the model number Samsung SMH1816S.<br />If, you have not had a problem in the first year consider yourself lucky. When you have had two problems in 18 months with this unit it is time for a recall on your product. Stay away from this microwave unless you don't mind an inconvenience and spending more money.
Worked great for the first 2 years than completely broken.  AFter charging me $99 to look at my microwave, the GE repairman indicated that the repair would cost over $400.  Wow - what a ripoff.  I expected a profile to last a little longer than that.  If you want to replace this in 2 years - go ahead and buy.  Otherwise, look for a brand other than GE.
This microwave was installed by our builder in our new home a year and a half ago.  I'm not sure why, as I have since found out that the service technician for this area has been out numerous times to replace these microwaves.  Ours died after 17 months of regular use.  It will run but will not heat anything.  I called Whirlpool to troubleshoot this, and all they did was put me through an automated call that set up a service appointment.  At no point did they tell me what this service call would cost.  So I had to call back and get a customer service rep who told me it would be $129 for someone to come out to my home.  That of course does not include any parts or replacement.  I can buy a brand new microwave that works from a better company for twice that.  Why would I fix a microwave that broke in a little over a year of use.  In all my years of microwave use, I have never had a microwave break.  It's pretty ridiculous to me to have it break in a little over a year, especially when my neighbor had hers break two months prior.  I would never buy a Whirlpool appliance again.
Purchased this product from Warehouse Deals (Fulfilled by Amazon) which was advertised as USED but in GOOD condition, microwave oven arrived April 28, 2012. The product did not work and the door was damaged. Contacted GE Tech support who dispatched a repair tech to my home on May 1, 2012, who indicated the door was bent and the microwave had internal damage. He also stated he would ship the parts to my home and when they arrived to call GE for him to return. On May 5, 2012 the parts arrived, notified GE immediately and a tech representative  would be responding Monday May 7, 2012. I don't know if this product  had damage before it was shipped by Warehouse Deals or it was destroyed in transit by UPS. I will keep this situation updated as time progresses then either keep the rating or change it? Just a note...reading all the bad reviews on this particular GE Profile Spacemaker microwave oven (PEM31SMSS) I'm contemplating  having additional problems with this particular GE microwave. I really had no choice, this unit replaced my old GE Profile Spacemaker microwave (JEM31SF01) that was built into a custom kitchen cabinet; as I required the exact dimensions/screw lineup for the interior metal holding frame and the stainless steel trim covers.<br /><br />Update 5/9/12: The GE technical representative responded to my residence Monday 5/7/2012 who subsequently replaced the front door and some internal electronic parts. The new door still did not align properly with the frame. The rep contacted GE and informed them of the continuous failure of the door not to align correctly. A decision was made to replace the entire unit with a new replacement. I will keep this situation updated if and when the new microwave arrives from GE.<br /><br />Update: 5/17/12: A brand new microwave was delivered to my home and installed by a installation/repair company sub-contracted by GE. One of the installers from this third party company advised me this specific GE Profile Spacemaker microwave oven (PEM31SMSS) is their #1 problematic GE microwave; for the reason that the inside paint peels-off within 3 to 6 months of use. The gentleman also indicated they exchange these microwave's more than any other GE microwave. With all this latest documentation and all the negative reviews on this particular model (PEM31SMSS) what's the probability of my new microwave lasting the test of time???..... Mediocre To Put It Mildly. As I previously indicated, I had no recourse, since I needed a replacement to fit into a custom cabinet, with the correct dimensions/screw lineup for the interior metal holding frame and the stainless steel trim covers; these two items cost more than the entire microwave alone. In conclusion, I would recommend everyone to purchase a different model GE or a different brand all together.oven (PEM31SMSS) is their #1 problematic GE microwave; for the reason that the inside paint peels-off within 3 to 6 months of use.

Warning:  For appliances, Amazon.com reviews are skewed to the low side.  Most people who write appliance reviews do so because their apppliance stopped working and they get mad and want to take it out on the company.<br /><br />The Problem:  most microwaves are made by a few Asian companies.  GE has stopped manufacturing most small appliances and even some major appliances.  Many of the GE refridgerators are not only made in Korea, they were designed and engineered by Korea and only have a GE label slapped on them.  The expensive GE Profile microwaves are made by the guys who make the Panasonic and other microwaves.<br /><br />With an appliance or piece of electronics, it can be the luck of the draw.  There is a basic reliablity curve, called the bathtup curve. In the first few months of a product's life, there is a high percentage of units that fail.  Then, if you get past that, there is a long period where the odds of your product failing is very low, until end of life is reached, maybe 10 to 20 years later.  The people who write reviews in Amazon are the unfortunate ones who products fail during that initial period.<br /><br />My microwave broke after 4 months.  But, GE customer service is great.  I called them up.  They came to my house the same day.  It needed parts the repair did not have on his truck.  He ordered the parts, which came 2 days later.  I made another appointment and my microwave was back in a week.<br /><br />This microwave is big inside.  I don't know how imporantant that is.  We can put big plates or platters in it.  But, if it wasn't so big, I could just put the food in smaller bowl.<br /><br />It has lots of heating options.  But, so do the cheapest microwaves.  Personally, I don't think any of those heating options are of any value.  It is not like they are reliable to work automatically.  With any microwave, you experiment a couple of times and then you konw what setting to use.<br /><br />Really, there are only 3 important features for amicrowave:<br /><br />1.  How it looks.  I think this looks great.<br /><br />2.  Power.  This is 1200 watts and heats food fast.  I wouldn't get anything under 1000 watts.<br /><br />3.  Quality.  Unfortunately, I don't think you can do much about this.
I have to agree with the other 1 star review. I would also give it zero stars if possible. This is my second GE Microwave that has died after one year. Last time it was the turntable motor, this time it was the control panel.  Of course the replacement is over $125. They produce garbage. No more GE for me.
I got this wine cooler as a gift. Looks nice.  I saw the reviews and assumed that the machine will fail after a few months.  It lasted barely more than a year and a half. After approximately a year it was making very loud noises and it did not longer cool. I use it as a wine rack (off) but will bring it to the curve one of this days.<br /><br />run away.
Buy anything else, just don't buy this piece of junk.  Multiple electrical problems, a door lock that failed, poor performance and lousy customer service all at a premium price.  You can buy better but you probably can't pay more.
It is the right price but it is not the same size as it says.  We had the exact same one just a little older and this one was slightly smaller.  1/4 on all sides.
This microwave has had one problem after another since it was installed close to a year ago. It's prone to all sorts of computer malfunctions. Let's see if I can even remember them all. We've had it start up again after pulling food out and closing the door (without hitting start again). It's often (50+ times) sounded as if it was working, but when I realized it had been an awfully long time without it chiming, I found that it had frozen just a few seconds into the heating. The most disturbing problem was that it has on perhaps five occasions turned on on its own--with no one in the room. There have been many occasions where it has just not worked at all. When this happened, unplugging it and plugging it back in used to reset it so that it would work. Unfortunately, it now won't work at all, with just the code, SE flashing on its display.<br /><br />We're buying a new microwave this weekend, and I can guarantee it won't be a Samsung.
In January 2011 I purchased a PEM31SMSS GE spacesaver microwave because it was the only microwave with >400 watts of power I could find that would fit in the space I have.  It looked nice - better than a plain black box.  Approximately 4 months later the keypad stopped working and the microwave was replaced under warranty.  In August of 2011 the replacement microwave wouldn't turn off, and was replaced under warranty.  In March of 2012 after heating a cup of coffee, the third microwave just went dark and wouldn't work any more.  The stainless model was no longer available and was replaced with the black, which arrived yesterday.  Today I unpacked it and plugged it in.  The interior light won't turn off and there is no keyboard response when I press the START button because something in the latch isn't making contact.  I think I've had one of everything that could go wrong.  I would definately not recommend purchasing a GE spacemaker microwave of any style.
Picked this up at our local Lowes for a good price. This model has the real stainless handle, and not the painted-grey handle I saw on a lower end model. We installed it with minimal problems for our kitchen out of the 1960's that usually has non standard things (finding a fridge that fit was very painful). We needed one with a low clearance distance to the cook-top - 14 inches or less, and Samsung meets the bill at 13 inches. After using a counter-top microwave for the past few years, this seems huge. I'm still learning all the features, but am certainly pleased by the power of the fan. I'm exploring the use of the sensor cooking and can't wait to use the rack to be able to actually cook the amount of squash I want at once - the old microwave was just too small. I'll update this review if I run into any problems as we run it through it's paces, but so far it was relatively easy to install and is easy to use.
I bought this microwave based on the Consumer Reports product ratings and up until a couple of days ago I would have highly recommended it. Unfortunately that is no longer the case. I awoke to sounds of it beeping every few minutes and an error code of SE. After a lot of research I have seen that this same code has appeared for a fair amount of others. Both the short and the long of it is that it can no longer be used with out spending good money after bad. I know that they don't make things now days to last a lifetime, but I would have hoped for it to last longer than less than 2 years. We are light users and I kept it very clean. I wish that I would have bought an extended warranty. I can only hope that I go the same way this did...quick and without warning and that someone would also say she was good while she lasted.
[[ASIN:B000UW1WW8 GE Profile : JES2251SJ 2.2 cu. ft. Countertop Microwave with Child Lockout and Extra Large<br />Capacity<br />I purchased this product less than two years ago & today it finally just stopped.This was considered a very good micro, however it should have lasted much longer. I no longer have any faith in GE products and would never recomend this product to anyone!
After owning this microwave for less than 3 years, we have had the door handle break off on the bottom TWICE!  The first time we had it fixed - which cost nearly as much as the microwave.  This was just over 1 year after purchasing (of course, because it was no longer under warranty).  Now, just over three years in, it has broken off again - exact same problem.  Oh, AND the glass on the front of the door somehow came undone on the top and fell down about two inches.  Absolutely the worst appliance we have ever owned.  I have also had problems with my LG dryer after less than 4 years of owning it.  LG should track down everyone who purchased this microwave and give them a refund.  I will never, ever buy another LG product again, no matter what type.
We've had ours (probably an older model) since 2004.  Paint in the back just peeled and it's doing some sparking.  Be careful, everyone.
Our JES2251SJ02 lasted 4 months past the 12 month warranty. The inverter blew and the cost for a replacement inverter was $225, a new JES2251SJ02 is $258 so were trashing it. GE is sending us a $100 credit check good only for another GE appliance. The repair man recommended buying the cheapest microwave available and getting the extended warranty on any appliance. Everything out there is trash, said he. I'm afraid he is right.
After just two and a half years of use, the paint--is it really paint???--is peeling off the inside top in large pieces. No doubt we've eaten more unnoticeable bits. The microwave is built in. Anybody find a better one with the same dimensions?
Bought a Whirlpool over the range microwave and in less than six months needed a new magnetron.  It was repaired at no cost under warranty but rattles like it's ten years old.  Bought a used small Sharp micro at least ten years old, it works quietly and probably will outlast the Whirlpool.  Their refrigerators also are sub par. Dispenses warm water before it is cold, door shelf flimsy and falls off easily. No gallon storage in door and shelves cannot be placed without checking that the door will close. And, finally, the less than one year old KitchenAid disposal quit after jamming constantly, replaced with a quiet InSinkerator. Yes, KitchenAid is owned by Whirlpool.
I've had two service calls with this microwave within the one year warranty.  If it goes again, they tell me I am on my own. Shame on Whirlpool. I suspect that it may be more efficient to purchase a new microwave instead of having a service call for a circuit board that continues to be an issue. I'd steer away from this one....
We moved into a house that already had the MCO160UW microwave oven installed. After a few months the microwave would stop working and then randomly run on by its self for 3 minutes and 30 seconds. After deciding the microwave needed to be replaced for safety reasons we looked for another. We purchased one with the same length and width but after installing it realized the adjacent cabinet door wouldnt open since it  is at an angle due to the microwave sticking out too far from the wall. The standard size is 16'deep and up. Anything over 15' deep will stick out too far for the cabinet to open and the ONLY microwave available anywhere with 14.9' depth was this one. We desperately needed a new microwave so decided to give this same model, MCO160UW, a second try it failed again after 1 week of use. It will not run longer than 1 minute and 30 seconds at a time until it shuts off. In order to use it again you must wait a few minutes for it to turn back on. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
Last evening when I went to open the door on my Whirlpool microwave/convection/hood unit, which is about 26 months old, the handle cracked through completely, leaving it hanging by whatever supports the top of the handle (screws, I assume). Soooo, today I called Whirlpool to discuss the problem...the first person that I spoke with offered me a contract for $285 that she said would cover the service call, all parts & labor, plus would give me warranty coverage for 1 year.  Since the service call was going to be $129, I accepted the $285 offer (which I had to accept within 24 hours or it would not be offered to me again).  After verifying at least 3 times that this would cover all expenses incurred, I gave her my credit card # and she transferred me to what was to be the service appointment scheduling extension; actually, it was the extended warranty department, who told me that this $285 contract did not cover handles, knobs, etc...one hour later (was I frustrated by this or what???) still on the phone, having been transferred at least 6 times (each person I spoke with had the same message...I apologize).  I didn't want any more apologies...I wanted action!!!  The only action I got after FINALLY speaking with a supervisor was that I could cancel the contract (as if I didn't know this much), but it would take a few days to have my credit card credited.  Oh, when I told one of the 6 people I spoke with during that hour that I Googled this problem and found that I was not the only one that experienced this, she told me that competitors post those comments on Amazon.com...grrrrr.  I need to replace a dishwasher, stove, & refrigerator...they won't be Whirlpool.
I've had this microwave for a year now, and it has performed flawlessly. It also looks great, and is very easy to clean, inside and out. The best thing is the one-touch start for things like tea and re-heating. I don't feel like I have to program a computer just to make something to eat.
This microwave stopped working 364 days after we bought the house. Unfortunately it was the Firday before a holiday weeked and I was not able to contact Whrilpool until the following week. Whrilpool refused to honor the warranty when I called becasue it was two day expired.   A service repair man then came to the house to diagnose the problem. He told me the the microwave needed an new magnetron and control board. However, he said me that I should just get a different microwave. If I replaced the parts in this microwave he would probably be back in another year becuase Whrilpool had so many problems with this model. After that recommendation I looked at reviews on the Whrilpool web sight and Amazon, defective magnetrons seem to be a problem with this unit.   I would not recommend purchasing this unit since it seems that there is a problem with functionality and their warranty department is unwilling to budge on anything.
I bought this Microwave oven on June 1st 2010.  The handle is broken apart and the handle is loose  also the bottom of the doors have a crack.
I am completely disappointed in this microwave.  It stopped working after about 16 months, hence it was beyond warranty.  Every microwave I have ever owned has lasted at least 5 years!  Now Whirlpool wants to charge me $100.00 service fee?  This despite all of the documented magnetron issues in the reviews, yet they claim to not have any documented problems with this model.  DO NOT purchase a microwave from Whirlpool.  It's beautiful to look at, but now it's just a giant (pricey) paperweight hanging above my range.  I'll never buy anything from them again! It doesn't DESERVE a star, and neither does Whirlpool's customer service!
I had been using this microwave for only about two years when it suddenly began turning itself on! REALLY scary!! A bad fire hazard, and I have found others who report the same phenomenon with the same model. Wondering why it has not been recalled and who to lodge a complaint with!!
We owned this unit over 3 years.  The electronics went bad after a year.  It took 6 tries to get it working.  As reported elsewhere in these reviews, the machine would turn on all by itself.  Scary and dangerous.  Whirlpool would not replace the unit.  I wonder why these units weren't recalled.    The plastic parts (not a stainless steel unit) distorted and cracked in several places.  Those parts were replaced (under a separate warranty contract) 3 times!  The unit again has cracks and no warranty.  Last week, the bottom part of the door handle pulled out of the unit; it's held in by a small rubber flange that is sandwiched between the outer glass and an inner flat plastic piece.  Websites tell me that the glass must be disassembled to get a new handle inserted!  Gad!  It's outta here.  And the real shame is that the cooking functions are excellent.  But the next one will not be a Whirlpool, nor any other of Whirlpool brands. (Whirlpool makes/owns Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Admiral, Amana, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, and Maytag.)
Update: Jan 21, 2012  Just when I thought my experience with Frigidaire could not get any worse, it in fact did.  Having the WARRANTY is worse than not having one.  The Microwave is not working from just around Christmas.  Early January, it should have been fixed.  The Service company called and told me that the parts are not available, so the next possible touch point is Feb 18th.  So, looking at guaranteed no microwave for about 2 months, and even after that there is uncertainty when it would be fixed.  Had I NOT had the Warranty, I would have just taken a loss and gone ahead an purchased another Microwave of a brand called NOT FRIGIDAIRE.  ===========  - This Microwave lasted less than 6 months  - Of course you think all should be fine because it is under warranty.  - Yes, it is under warranty, BUT:    a) you are given the direct contact of a Service Provider, and you are no longer working with Frigidaire directly.    b) So, the buck is passed from Frigidaire over to a third party Appliance Service company    c) The appliance service company guy came, took a look at the Microwave and said they will need to order parts either from their local supplier, or directly from distributor. This could take up to 10 days  So, now you are left hanging without a  Microwave for 10 days or more. With the time off needed to be away from Office to handle the multiple appliance service company appointments, the Warranty is just not worth it.  Also, called Frigidaire customer service.  The Customer Service person was TERRIBLE, and basically told me to deal with it and stop complaining.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY A FRIGIDAIRE PRODUCT.
Mounting an over the range microwave is a pain. The price is not worth replacing the unit every 10-11 months. Buy something else.
I purchased this microwave to match other Frigidaire appliances I have, with price in mind. I missed that you don't have the ability to turn off the turntable on this model--it seems like that should be standard anymore. If you are cooking in something too large to make the rotation, the turntable function can be damaged. I'm not used to having to push a cook time button before selecting the time. I'll get used to that, though. It gives three long beeps when the time is up, which is kind of annoying to me for some reason. Even when you open the door, the beeps continue. I haven't used it much yet. I tried the popcorn feature, and it needed at least another minute of cooking time beyond what that is preset for. I like that you can add 30 seconds with the touch of a button. But if I'd had more time (home construction--it arrived and was installed right away) and had purchased it locally where it would be easy to return, I would have returned it and opted for a different model. It looks nice, and I'm sure it will be fine.
This looks good and does what it is designed to do. My main niggle about this is that it is rather noisy, but as I only really use it for short periods anyway no more than 4 minutes at a time it is no big deal.
I had this installed when I did my first kitchen remodel about 6 years ago. Then all of a sudden in April of 2009, the unit stopped working. Everything else was fine except that it would not heat the food. It would even make all the noise and so on. So, I had to replace it, and decided to just buy a new one and reinstall it. To my horror, less than 2.5 years later, I have the exact same failure. On top of this, if you need any repair service, they charge you a minimum of $100 to just come and diagnose and on top of that charge you for parts and labor! I am so unhappy and furious for this to have happened twice in a row. I will never again buy anything from GE!!! And charging almost 40% of the price of a new unit just for someone showing up at your door is quite silly.
After reading the specs, my husband measured the height before installing. We replaced the cabinet over the stove to a shorter cabinet (we were remodelling the kitchen), so we have none of the problems with the heat on the latching mechanism other people mentioned.  I love all of the features on this microwave (especially the sensor cooking), it was easy to install, and after 8 years my only complaint is that the LED readout has completely burned out, so my cooking is now by braile.  I was checking Amazon to see how much money to replace this microwave and was really surprised by the reviews.  I will purchase this product again when it finally quits working.
Microwave MCO165UW  over heats and turns off.  First week had repairman out, ordered parts, after 3 weeks Magic Chef still had not sent parts, sent them 2 day.  Repairman came back out and replaced parts.  Still overheated.  Magic Chef said heat water if it does not turn off it works like it is suppose to.  Cannot steam vegetables, cook baked potatoes and so forth.  Who buys a microwave just to heat water?  Do yourself a favor and NEVER BUY Magic Chef.
My story is so similar to the other reviews.  Bought mine in 3/2008 - loved it worked fabulous for about a year.  Just to the end of the warranty.  Whirlpool's response to my request for warranty service at 13 months on a top of the line appliance was Tough Luck - you should have bought our warranty.  I got it fixed $200.  Then I bought the warranty - $125.  Two months later, it was down again.  Over 3 months, and 4 appointments, they replaced nearly every interior part.  Finally it was fixed again.  Two weeks later.....it is down again.  Very disappointing.
I have had no problem with the microwave -- everything has worked well since I bought the house 6 years ago, when the microwave was already 2 years old. The paint just now started to peel on the inside roof of the microwave, and since I am told that is problematic for paint chips in the food and for interfering with the magnetron, I need to replace the unit. I have the same problem as others who have posted reviews -- my kitchen has custom cabinets with a space for this size unit. I could remove my stove hood and fit an over-the-stove microwave/fan unit, but that would leave a hole where the current unit is located, and I would need to buy a custom cabinet for the hole. Seems like a lot of cost to just replace a microwave. Has anyone found another similarly sized unit? Or had GE fixed the obvious paint defect that is an obvious problem with this model?
Wow, Wow, Wow! I was somewhat concerned about purchasing a microwave over the internet, but how great it was. I was even more than satisfied with the product it looks wonderful and works great as well. The price was less than the one we saw in the store and the delivery time was faster than what the computer stated. I had it install the same day and I am very happy about this product and the overall purchase. I know you will too.
When I opened the box, I saw the corner next to the push button was lose.  The thin and cheap stainless steel is only on the front, everything else is either painted metal and plastic.   I can't believe that the seller Abes of Maine Cameras and Electronics did not check the product before ship to the customer
Dont buy frigidaire. I bought a set of appliances (this being one of them) and the only one I havent had issues with is the stove so far. Haven't even had the stuff a full year.
This General Electric microwave works fine as far as cooking things or heating up water; but my menu display has never worked. I can see the menu on the machine; but what the microwave is actually doing does not show up. It is a low powered microwave; so it takes a while to cook with it. I use it daily for cooking food and heating up water for tea or soup.     Underneath the rotating plate rusted as water from boiling water dripped down onto the inside of the microwave. So the plastic or polymer covering came off the bottom; but it works fine still spins around as it works. The light comes on when I open the door more than a year and a half later since I got it. It does not take up much space.
After 1 year of light use (maybe 3x per week to warm leftovers), the sensor stopped working and now the microwave does not heat anything.  The cost to repair is more than the appliance is worth.
We bought this to replace our GE that died after several services. Turned out to be very cheesy and after the warranty ran out the door handle cracked and then finally broke off. We will be replacing this with a GE which we should've done from the get go. This was a low price microwave but as the old saying goes...you get what you pay for . Some items can't be skimped on.
I would NEVER recommend this microwave to anyone. Within only a few months of owning, the handle broke off, and the front plastic cracked. Of course my husband lost the receipt, so we could not return it, so we've dealt with it with no handle for a year. Now the whole front plastic has broken off and the glass fell out so we can't use it any more. Why would LG continue to make such a poorly constructed product? The plastic is brittle and the construction is bad. I would say this microwave does not even heat food as well as some of my past cheap counter top models. If I could give this product 0 stars, I would. Please do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this product. We will never buy LG again.
I bought my microwave directly from Whirlpool in March 2011. In July 2011 it died. The first repair man came out a week later. He order parts waited another week , second repair man came out to put in the new part. He said it was fried & could not be fix. Well whirlpool is supposed to be replacing the microwave. It's 4 week later close to 5 weeks & still no microwave. The service department is awful.
I purchased this microwave in October 2008 (2 years and 10 months ago) after a disastrous experience with a GE Spacemaker.  If I could give half-stars, I would give the LG a 4.5 at this point. It was very reasonably priced compared to others with similar features, and reasonably easy to install.  It does a good job overall, has some features that the Spacemaker did not have, but also lacks some nice features that the (much more expensive) Spacemaker had.    Here's what I really like about the LG:  1. Multiple speed exhaust fan with timer.  2. More time/Less time buttons.  3. Soften/Melt/Defrost settings work well.  4. Turntable on/off setting is useful for large or oblong cooking vessels.  5. Popcorn, hot dog settings are very accurate.  6. Hold Warm feature keeps cooked items at a safe temp for up to 90 minutes.  7. It doesn't need the clock set just to use the microwave, (like the Spacemaker did.)  8. It works reliably every time I use it!    Here's what I feel the LG lacks:  1. Doesn't remind you after cooking is finished (the Spacemaker beeped discreetly every 30 seconds for up to an hour).  2. Reheat settings are sometimes a bit too aggressive.  3. Can't adjust the volume of the beeps when setting or finishing cooking (default volume is a bit loud).  4. Aesthetically, the black window on the front is not as attractive as the Spacemaker's white window.  5. Although the EZ-ON button starts and adds 30 second increments, a Quick-Minute button would be useful.  6. The turntable is smaller than it could be (although this has not really presented any problems).  7. The Spacemaker had an automatic nightlight feature, the LG does not (this is a small inconvenience).    At this point in its lifetime, I would recommend this microwave.  If that changes, I'll update this review accordingly.
The GE Profile countertop microwave 2.2 cu.ft. is not only a sleek looking appliance on our counter but is easy to use and allows for large capacity food items.  Very satisfied with our purchase.
This microwave was very hard to install, and I am pretty handy. Within a month the numbers stopped lighting up and some of the touch buttons (such as defrost button) stopped working. Within another month the push button door latch stopped functioning and we had to take it off, now we have to use a screwdriver to pop the door open. The stainless steel started to turn brownish and doesn't come off. Recently the lights started turning on by themselves and today was the last straw when the fan came on by itself and wouldn't turn off. That is why I am on here looking for a new one. Save yourself a major headache and don't buy it!!
I knew this microwave had poor reviews even before I purchased it, but it was literally the only microwave I could find that would fit properly in an upper cabinet and not stick out.  So on that score, it does really well - this really is a great-looking microwave that fits in an upper cabinet and looks custom.  Unfortunately, one month after I purchased it, the trim on the right side of the microwave around the door button started falling off - and it was easy to see why as it was attached only with two-sided tape.  I called up Mabe Canada customer support and after describing the problem and faxing in my receipt, they shipped a replacement microwave straight to my door within 3 business days.  I wish there was an alternative to this microwave, but I'm stuck with it for now, and I have to admit the customer service was fantastic.  Hopefully my replacement will hold up.
I was laughing when I read the reviews, the same exact thing happen to us, we just bought a new condo and the microwave came with it. I started thinking that may be the house was haunted or something. The control panel stopped working and the microwave start by itself and stop by itself. Stay away from this microwave you'll waste your money.
My 1st unit fried and was unuasable. It was replaced after a few customer service calls and a service tech visit. The replacement unit makes a big noise and the vent fan is so loud that the entire sub division could hear our microwave. I have gone through several calls to their customer service and two service visits later the issue is still not fixed. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT. It wasn't my choice..I got it from the new home I purchased and I am sure it's not going to last even 3 months.
What I like about the Whirlpool/Kitchen Aid microwaves is they offer models with Accuwave cooking.  When you cook at 50% power, it cooks at 50% power rather than cycling on and off at 100% power, for 50% of the time.  This makes a massive difference on how things cook.  We previously had a GH5184XPS with Accuwave that lasted 4 years before it stopped cooking.  It was starting to not look so nice from normal use, so I decided to go with a new one instead of repairing the old one.      After the new microwave was installed, I tried a cup of water in it.  When I started it, it sounded like an arc welder, and when I looked at the plastic panel on the right side where the magnetron is, it looked like an arc torch flame.  I quickly turned it off so it wouldn't burn the place down.  They took it back and gave me another.  The very night we got it, we were making popcorn in the special Microwave Popcorn bowl, which we had used for years with our other microwaves.  Within a minute, we got an F7 - Call For Service code.  They offered to exchange it for a new one, but didn't have another, but told me they could sell me the new 5184, and updated model of our old one.  I noticed that the new one had a broiler, slightly different menus, $50 cheaper, and we had good luck with our previous 5184.  However, after it was installed, the cook said, this doesn't cook right.  I checked it out.  The updated 5184 no longer has Accuwave.  That isn't how it was represented, so I gave them their $50 back and had them order another one of these from the factory.  That went along for 3 days before we noticed that part way through the cooking time, the magnetron noise would stop, the fan speed up, the light got brighter, and the food stopped cooking.  Since the chicken was still pink, I added 2 minutes at full power, and immediately received an F7 code.  The problem actually started when it stopped cooking during the previous operation.  You don't get the F7 until you try to start it again,and the magnetron doesn't start.  We couldn't trust it with chicken.  We avoided certain foods and alternated between manual and automatic cycles to get around the F7 codes.  As time progressed, we could do less and less.  Now, you can't even trust it to finish a bowl of oatmeal.      That was enough for me.  There is no possibility of buying a good one from the factory, so there is no point in getting another new one.  Thus, I decided I would use warranty service to see if they can put in good parts that WILL work.  The dealer-recommended warranty repair source wouldn't take the job when he learned which model it was.  Whirlpool got another company to come the following morning.  They put a large bowl of water in the microwave to test it, and could find nothing wrong.  They said their manual doesn't even list an F7 code.  There is nothing easier on a microwave than a large bowl of water.  I went on the internet and printed off one of a myriad of postings about F7 for this microwave model, with detail instructions on how to troubleshoot.  Then I put real food in the microwave and showed them how easy it is to get an F7.  Included in the troubleshooting instructions were comments from the techs that service these every day who state that they always go through the procedure to eliminate any other causes, but it always ends up being the expensive microprocessor board.  The on-site techs did not follow the checklist, and called the factory.  The factory told them they will send them a switch to try.  (I was hoping it would be the thermal switch, but the techs indicated it was not.)  The on-site techs reminded the factory that the problem starts mid-cycle.  The factory came back with, as it gets hotter, the switch contacts may be increasing resistance, causing the problem.  I could repeat the F7 at will.  They did not check the switch for high resistance nor follow the factory procedure to troubleshoot the F7 error.  Next Wednesday, the switch is scheduled to be delivered, and the techs will be returning to put it in.  The service company also had little confidence in the factory's recommendation, but they have to do what the factory says.  Perhaps the fist service company has gone through this before and may be why they wouldn't take the job for this model.      I've been through 3 of this model, and 4 installs, since April 5 2011, and I don't have a good microwave yet.  They've eaten up more of my time than the microwave is worth.  Now it's my turn.  I will make it my personal mission to require them to keep sending technicians to my house to fix this model until it works as advertised, on real food, or supply me with a model of equal to or greater value, that works as advertised, for free, and with a new warranty.
Update:<br />After 16 months we have the same problem as others. It runs for 3 or 4 seconds and just shuts off.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I have only owned the microwave for a short time so I can not rate the reliability, not that my individual experience would necessarily be typical.  However, I can rate the features and design of the unit. I like the size, the power and the large turntable.  The controls, however, were poorly designed.  For example, to cook at anything other than full power, you need to press the power level repeatedly. The first press of the button gives you 100% power and each subsequent press reduces the power level by 10%. So, to cook something at 30% power it takes eight presses of the button.
[[VIDEOID:mo1LOHJ4VRRGAJT]]The good: My brand new, out of the box spacesaver is great looking, it is cabinet depth so it doesn't stick out, it fits perfectly under a cabinet (with the kit) and, when you can get the door open, it works really well.   I just completely redid my kitchen and it looks marvelous.      The bad:  the door doesn't open.   Seriously doesn't open. OK, I'm exaggerating.  If you really, really try, you can eventually get the door open.   From day one it didn't open.  See the video demo of my trying to open the door.      The better:  My wonderful local appliance dealer who sold it to me is not going to try to fix it.  They are sending me a new one and taking this one back. There are some benefits to paying a bit more and buying local.        I'll update this review when I get the new one.    I'm really hoping I get a good one like a subset of the microwaves all of you have.    However, you should not have to wish to be a subset when you are paying over $250 for a microwave.  They should all be good, quality microwaves.  There are so few under cabinet, cabinet depth, models available, we are sort of stuck with the GE Spacesaver.    ____________________    July 23, 2011    Update to my review on this microwave.   My appliance dealer send me a new one and it works just fine.   I've only had it about a month, so I don't know how it will last, but as of right now, it is functioning perfectly.
This machine's finish quality was off out of the box.  The door didn't quite line up with it's case when closed and there were a couple small dents on the lower left of the door as well.    These were tolerable, however, as long as the machine worked - and it did... sometimes.    For example, from the start this machine would occasionally shut off mid-cooking, as in the timer would go blank, the light would go out, and the food would still be pretty cold.      Other times the food would seem to be heating up pretty well but then the machine would shut off.  On those occasions we thought it might have quit because it was getting too much steam on its sensors (wherever they might have been) so we would wrap foods extremely tightly with plastic wrap - still to no avail.      On still other occasions the food **looked** like it was being cooked (light stayed on, the table rotated, the timer counted down, and tone sounded at the end) but then it would turn out to be only ever so slightly warmer than when originally put in.    After a year of our just making do with this machine's cranky behavior and then just planning our meals without microwave use it died altogether.    My wife and I can only say, Good riddance! in response.    Consumer Reports lists this microwave as a best buy and, honestly, that's why I bought it in the first place.  Unfortunately, this machine is far, far, far from being a good buy much less a Best Buy!!!  Based on my experience and those of the others who wrote in here I won't be touching a GE microwave for years, if then.
We purchased ours about 6 months ago and we find it to work as about as well as we assumed it would given it's low power and lower price. Expect longer heating times than a larger microwave oven. If you are an impatient person you may want to pass on this model.    The Hot Water presets work fine for reheating coffee.    Our one real complaint is that the turntable is all too easily dislodged from the spindle if a heavy item is not carefully placed near the center of the surface. We find this design defect really annoying and would not choose this model again for this reason alone.
The box was somehow very light, and right then, I knew we had made a mistake.      This microwave is almost like a toy.  It is very tiny and underpowered.  We unpacked it and put in a pack of popcorn. Well, it spun around on top strength for over two minutes without a single pop.  After 3-4 minutes about half of the popcorn was popped.  Forget it. It must have been broken, or maybe just for making things warm, not hot.    We returned it right away. Speedy return system!
The incessant beeping is enough to make you want to put your own head inside the microwave. Next to that, when you select a defrost time, it literally stops every 30 seconds to tell you to turn it over. and wont start ubnless you open and close the door then push start again I HATE THIS THING. Good thing it LOOKS NICE because the features, the beeping, and the UI is absolutely UNNERVING. I am writing this as some steaks are defrosting in it and the constant stops and beeping has just finally gotten me to the point where I had to come here and whine about it.
I purchased this produce when it first came it and loved the look of the unit.  Within a year the interior paint has peeled off on the inside of the door and the inside of teflon coating of the unit.  The stainless still overs have been glued back on 3 times now and just recently the door handle broke.  I never leave review because honestly I am too lazy but I just had to warn buyers of this product.  I have contacted Whirlpool twice and they told me that the paint was cosmetic and is only covered under the 30 day warranty.  Really??? paint is supposed to chip within 30 days?  Then the other parts are also cosmetic but they can get an technician to come out at my cost of course.  Lastly, despite all the bad reviews, the have determined this product has no quality issues. I will NEVER buy a whirlpool product again.
I have made the mistake of buying two GE space saver microwaves for my two homes. Both have badly peeling paint not only inside the door but on the back wall of the microwave as well. Got same answer form GE.buy the paint and paint it myself.  Did buy the paint but by then the rust was too extensive to nake it work. I am also looking for a nice microwave about the same size and features!
I bought this because I don't have a double oven in my kitchen and this can serve that purpose.  If you have a double oven, then I think you are better off with a standard high quality microwave.    This is a high speed microwave convection oven; but due to the size of the cavity the conv oven takes longer to heat up.  About 10 minutes to reach 350. Once preheated convection works good.      Does a nice job with frozen pizza, rib roast, chicken, etc. This makes really good toast in 6 minutes, 3 minutes per side, you have to flip the bread. But I don't think it saves any time.  Also, when you use the convection oven, remember it has to cool down to use it again as a microwave. That can take another 10-15 minutes.    Bought mine about 4 yrs ago with a 5yr extended warranty. Within the last month, a piece of plastic trim fell off, door handle cracked, and the touch screen started randomly simulating keypresses.    Repair service came out 3x to get the right parts ordered and repaired, maybe it's fixed.  Will find out.    Cooks well.  The best feature is that this is a variable microwave; unlike most units that simply turn the magnetron on and off to vary the Power %, this one actually reduces the power itself... very cool.  This also combines microwave with convection bake and grill capabilities, and you can control the bake temp as well as the % of microwave to use. For grilling you control the microwave % but not the grill temp, as the grill halogen just stays on the whole time.  That isactually a very nice feature.  On my regular oven, the broiler turns off at 500.    So from that standpoint the unit is pretty smart.    Get this on a firesale if you can... get a long term 5yr + extended warranty, you will use it.    As other's point out, it doesn't have program cooking, can't do a delayed start, can't do multiple programs in sequence, doesn't have a meat thermometer, but it does have a lot of pre-sets.  So, it's an OK unit; I haven't really found anything that competes with it.  Would be interested in hearing feedback on better choices.
As a vertically-challenged individual, I was looking forward to getting a countertop microwave when we remodelled our kitchen.  However, I was not looking forward to giving up the multiple functions offered by my larger, over-the-stove microwave.  Additionally, I did not want to give up my useable counter space which I would have to do with the standard 18 inch or more deep countertop microwaves.  I also wanted enough space left on the counter so that, if necessary, when removing something from the microwave, I could sit the container on the counter immediately in front of the microwave.  I had a small 24 inch wide by 14 inch deep nook available between my refrigerator and the corner appliance garage, but was certain I would not find a suitable microwave to fit.  Since we were not replacing cabinets, I had to work with the available spaces.<br /><br />To my surprise, the GE Profile Spacemaker II was the exact size of the nook!  Although there were many negative reviews of the product, I decided to take a chance on this microwave and purchased one at Best Buy.  Through an abundance of caution, I also purchased an additional 4 year warranty so that if I experience any of the problems others have encountered, I will be able to have the Spacemaker II repaired or replaced.  As the extended warranty was only a little more than a service call would cost, I felt it was worth the expenditure.<br /><br />So far, I am very pleased with the GE Profile Spacemaker II microwave.  My spouse and I do not cook meals in our microwave, but do reheat beverages; cook frozen vegetables and veggie burgers; and, occasionally, defrost meat.  The Spacemaker performs these functions admirably!  Although it takes about 30% more time to heat/cook things than my 1100 watt microwave, this has not been a problem.  Further, I like this model better for defrosting as it does not start cooking the meat like the more powerful models do.  The control panel buttons are very responsive.  I have cracked other microwave's button surfaces because of the difficulty in getting them to respond to my touch.  I do not foresee this occuring with the Spacemaker II.<br /><br />In the past, I have allowed bread to raise inside my microwave.  I found this allowed me to leave the bowl or pan uncovered as there is no air flow inside the microwave, and the temperature remains consistent.  The Spacemaker's interior is large enough for me to continue using the microwave in which to raise bread.<br /><br />Because I keep this microwave on my counter, I keep a plastic glass of water in it to prevent accidentally starting it empty and possibly ruining the magnatron.<br /><br />Further, I would caution those who are looking for a compact microwave for an elderly individual who may be confused by having to choose among multiple function buttons.  The GE Profile Spacemaker II has a control panel that can be confusing as it has 29 separate buttons from which to choose.  Thus, it might not be the best choice for individuals.<br /><br />For me, the GE Profile Spacemaker II is the ideal microwave and I am giving it a five-star rating.  If things change, I will update my review accordingly.s button surfaces because of the difficulty in getting them to respond to my touch.  I do not foresee this occuring with the Spacemaker II.

fridgidaire over the range (fmv 156 dca) looks nice but nothing but trouble.  First the handle broke. I fixed it. Then the diode/rectifire failed--i replaced that and the magnitron, worked for a year than died in the middle of cooking a baked potatoe. Replaced diode--still not working. I am giving up and never buying fridigaire again.  BTW i replaced it with a maytag--what do you know, as soon as i tried to cook some popcorn it shut off. It only will stay on for 10 seconds or so before shutting off. I am taking it back and am wondering how much bad luck can one have--or is this all a conspiracy to keep microwave service people busy.
Looks good, and had all the features we wanted.  Too bad it melted it's wiring last night.  Costs more to repair than to simply replace with newer less expensive model.
We purchased a new house which led us to purchase a new microwave and refrigerator.  We chose GE for both.  After six months the ice maker stopped working.  After 6 years, a refrigerator which still looks brand new, was freezing all of the food in the refrigerator section.  Next came the refrigerator section not cooling at all.  We had to go purchase yet another refrigerator as we couldn't deal with our food going back all the time based on the reliability of this refrigerator.  Moved this GE refrigerator down the basement to use for excess drinks, etc. during the holidays.  Repair man just left after telling me it was too expensive to fix and he would not guarantee that something else didn't go wrong.  Oh yeah, forgot to mention, my GE microwave broke last week also.  After reading the reviews/complaints on GE appliances, I will never ever put a GE appliance in my house.  Spread the word.....
I bought this appliance over a year ago and since then have been having a lot of problems with the door. The plastic handle cracked a few months after use, and this was repaired by their service. A few months later, the same problem occurred again, but this time created a tiny crack on the door itself. Again it was serviced for the handle alone. Just after the 1-year warrantee expired, the handle cracked the 3rd time, this time creating a much bigger fissure on the door so that it now cannot be opened. While the machine still functions, the design of the door is so poor that I would not at all buy another microwave from LG again. In all the houses I have owned, this is the first time I have any problems with any microwave.I would not at all recommend it.
This microwave was great while it worked, but it didn't work near long enough.  I expect more from a product at this price point, especially one that Consumer Reports rated very highly. Unfortunately I've owned this microwave for approximately 18 months, only to a have the Magnatron--apparently the part that makes it heat--go out.  I've contacted Whirpool on 3 occasions and have not been very happy with my results.  First they agreed to pay for the labor and NOT the part, then they agreed to pay for the part and NOT the labor.  The part is back-ordered so I'm stuck with no microwave and paying for something that--judging by the number of other complaints on here--is obviously a manufacturing a error. I would advise staying far away from this product and this company.
Door broke near the handle in less than one year.  Had the door replaced under warranty.  Now the new door is breaking in the exact same fashion in less than a year (but now it's out of warranty!).  New door costs over $100.  Serious design or manufacturing flaw.  I can't recommend this microwave.  Very disappointed.
I had this microwave GH7208XRS slightly over one year ago. Today the digital display went out. It is going to cost alot of repair it. I definitely would not recommend anyone buy this unit unless you get the extended warranty.
Looks great, functions awesome while it is working. But with the digital display, it breaks very soon, and when it breaks, it feels like you can't get it fixed. Whirlpool would not respond well. They just direct us to local repair shops, and the response from them is horrible. Any replacement parts are always on back order and it is just a night mare to try to work with them sanely. I have been fighting with them for more 6 months now, and I just am so frustrated that I spend so much money on a product that would only work for few months, and I kept this useless microwave sitting nicely in the middle of my kitchen, just idle.     Horrific design and horrible customer service from Whirlpool.
As good or better than i hoped! Lots of options, fan is great. It is noisier than my old one (as per other reviews) but really...it doesn't matter that much.
We also experienced problems with the paint peeling in this microwave.  It is no longer under warrenty and I was told by GE that this was an isolated incident.  Obviously, that is not the case.  I would not recommend this product especially since GE is unwilling to stand behind their product.
Purchased this above the range microwave while searching for a different size by accident. Kept it for my work home, work in a different state than we live. Installed it and it does not work. Been working with the factory to get it working instead of returning it. Still trying after 3 weeks. First they sent me to the wrong repair shop, then the replacement part was bad and now waiting on the 2nd part. I don't know if I would be as understanding if this was at family home.
Having had an Amana Radar range for the usual 25 years, I was forced to replace it when it finally failed.  (I had even dropped it on its end, my mother ran it empty, etc., and it just kept going.)  I replaced it with this unit which I used for coffee, leftovers, and maybe popcorn heat ups; nothing like the actual cooking I did with the old unit with its regular and candy temperature probes, etc.  Between 2-3 years old it just crackled and popped and limped along for a day or two with a hard reset.  Dead.  The popcorn setting never worked (other microwaves I have used elsewhere did a great job) nor was the sensing mechanism impressive.  I also didn't like you couldn't use the timer independently when it was running.  Sure, it may be the magnetron but you have to pay to diagnose then replace.  Although it is still top rated on Consumer Reports, read the users' reviews to get the true story.
I bought this Microwave in April of 2008.  After a few months it had intermittent bleeps and flashes on the screen and once even turned on by itself (it quickly turned itself off but scary nonetheless).  Then in In April of 2009 the screen went completely dead, and Whirlpool was nice enough to repair it at no cost even though the 1 year warranty was expired by about a week.  The problem was a bad circuit board.  Now the door hinge is broken, and the turntable has stopped spinning.  For the price of this oven I expect it to not fall apart in 2 years.  It cooks very well, both microwave and convection, when it works.  But with three major repairs in two years,  I can't recommend it at all.  If you do buy one, get the extended warranty.
I have an LG 1680BB over the stove microwave which is less than one year old.  The construction seems flimsy to me and the controls do not seem very well thought out.  It appears to me that the controls are made for a new family with really small children.  The presets are for things like oatmeal, babyfood, hot dogs, that sort of thing.    The main problem I have with the oven is that the handle just came off.  I looked closely at it and the plastic around the two screws which hold the handle on is melted and cracked.  It looks like the microwave heated that area enough that the plastic melted and then the rest of the handle cracked until it simply fell off.    I will never buy another LG microwave; not unless they are significantly improved.
I've had this mic for just over a year, and as with others, it just started turning on by itself this week. Fire hazard! Thank God I was home the first time it did it. It's 2.30am and it just woke me up by coming on again. Spooky to say the least, dangerous to say the most. I can't keep it plugged in anymore, and I assume, based on others' experience that I'm reading online, that it is no longer safe and I will have to get rid of it. What a rip off.
I bought the 1.6 cu ft white one of these. My older and twice as expensive Whirlpool died and I didn't want to spend another 500 bucks on something that I now realize is a disposable item. When these break, almost any repair will cost as much as a new unit so I decided to stop buying top tier on these ovens. This unit was easy to install. It's lighter than my Whirlpool was, so I was able to hoist it onto the mounting plate myself and start the top screws without a problem. I think perhaps those who are complaining about the weight bought the larger model? Who knows. Sometimes it's hard to tell what some folks bought in these Amazon reviews.<br /><br />As others report, the fan is REALLY loud. Wow. And low fan is just as loud. The fan is definitely the down side. I found that the light is bright enough. Cooking is fast. The control panel is very Spartan. Oh, it has all the buttons, but where my old microwave said Pizza and Casserole etc. in the display, this one just has a numeral and you'll have to refer to the book a bit until you get the hang of it. Most of my cooking is just hitting the quick button anyway, so let's be real. I'm glad it doesn't have a lot of features I'll seldom use and that I would have had to pay for. The door looks solid enough to me. I see no problem with keeping it clean that others have reported, but perhaps that's because mine is white? So it's a good basic microwave, as cheap as they come and it works just fine. I consider it a 5-star cheap microwave.<br /><br />Edit added:<br />Well, it has stopped working properly after 6 months. Most annoying is that the interior light will not turn off even though the door switches are working properly. While I liked the Spartan controls, my wife learned to detest that feature. I've decided not to have it repaired under warranty, but to be rid of it and buy a unit with better build quality. I'm dropping it down to 3 stars. It will probably be discontinued soon anyway but hate to leave my former rave review in place without changing it.without changing it.
Right size, cooks everything, Fast and convenient.  Just right for my needs. Can't go wrong with the deal or the unit.
I purchased a GE Profile Spacemaker 2.0 oven model #JVM2070 BHO2 in 2007. About a year later the handle came off in my hand. I did my own repair but in so doing found the quality of construction to be quite poor. Self threaded screws in inferior quality plastic was the problem. Now, the keypad will not accept any inputs. GE only sells a control assembly at nearly $400 (the oven originally cost about $500). GE says their ovens are not consumer repairable and refer customers to a repair facility. My options are to pay a GE technician $75.00 to tell me the control assembly must be replaced at a cost of $400 or buy another brand of oven with a longer service life. Which option do you think I will choose?
Too many problems for a high end microwave. After 1 year of use, the handle broke. The convection piece of it will not work. Stay away from this product.
I bought this microwave a few years back. Broke a year ago, waited a year to get it fix. This morning technician replaced inverter, worked......than he noticed it was on and off heating. Didn't warm up a cup of water. Told me the magnetron would need to be replaced. All about $500. STAY AWAY! Can't believe I spent $1,000 on this and 3 years later it's near the curb.......damn.....what an idiot I am....thanks Whirlpool...
Excellent price and product (2 day shipping with Amazon Prime - another really good investment!). This has turned out to be a very good buy as a replacement for a Sears Kenmore over the range microwave - which was useless from day one. It fits well, very secure mounts and easy to use template. Oven itself is easy to use, quiet, powerful, excellent venting (in our case out the top - to the roof). Everything has been easy to clean so far (including the buttons and window). I put it in myself - but two person job would have been a better choice. Really like the sensor cooking (so I don't have to figure out how long it will take to burn the rice this time...). Definitely recommend this oven.
PLEASE read the reviews, it could save you time, money and frustration.  I also bought a GE Microwave - Cafe thought it would be a quality product because I paid over $400.00, it also started dying after the first year, the magnatron, which has a five-year warrenty was corroded and had to be replaced at an additional $$ repair cost, part was free.  One day after the 30 day repair warrenty the microwave  totally died -$800 +.  Repair failed to come during appointed time, in fairness they later said they had called and rescheduled, but I had no message on my phone so I waited for 4 hours.  The manager I spoke to was willing to have me wait another five hours on another day, that's the best they could do.  So if you want to throw your money away and get poor service, definitely buy GE products!
THIS IS AWESOME! LOVE IT! IT WAS EASY TO INSTALL! COOKING AND DEFROSTING IS VERY WELL! AND THE SHIPPING WAS EARLY! VERY HAPPY OVERALL!
I like the look and functionality of this microwave and it is at a good price compared to others. My only negative feedback is that I feel it is a little loud when turned on (my husband thinks I only hate this because I don't like loud noises) and it doesn't heat things as fast as our old microwave. For this one, if the recommended cooking time is 3-5 minutes I will have to put it in for about 3:30, where on our old one I could put it in for 2:45.     Overall, though, it is a good product at a good price and has good functionality.
We bought one of these in October'09. It took three vists from a Whirlpool repair service before they could get the convection part to work. We weren't able to use the convection portion until late December'09. Now that it works, it is extremely noisy; both during cooking and during cool down. Yes, cool down. When you are finihed cooking it goes into a cool down mode for about another 15 minutes and is just as noisy. I admit that the micro wave works great and it has many features we like. My advice is to buy a microwave and a good broiler oven, if you are like us and do mostly cooking for two.
This microwave was a good price but it wakes people up with the loud operation and multiple beeps. Door also does not seem solid and is very loud if you are not holding it tight when you open and close. Was not worth the price considering all the noise.
Beware. I bought this over the range microwave in March of 2009, and it stopped working completely yesterday (Feb 25 2010). I use it once or twice per day. Normal stuff like TV dinners. It looks very nice, but it was NOT built to last.  I bought it online and I'm hunting through my archived e-mails trying to find my receipt so that I can get it serviced (preferably REPLACED). Earliest appointment is in a week, so I am without a microwave for at least a week.
This unit was a replacement for a slightly earlier model that failed.  It is nice that the LG over-the-range family generally uses the same wall-mount, so installation was easy as a replacement.   It works fine, though if you are a heavy users of microwaves, I am not sure what the real durability is, but since we are light users, the prior model lasted several years, and expect this will too.
This microwave has more features than ANY other on the market...and aesthetically it is a work of art!  When it works, it is fabulous, unfortunately that just isn't often enough.  We had this microwave for @ 3Â½ years and if we were lucky, we got 2Â½ years of use our of it.  Sadly, the sophistication of this appliance seems to be its Achilles heel.  There are so many feature to break and they do!    I could accept the fact that our unit was a lemon, however this was the second unit I purchased...the first died in two days and it was decided that the retailer would just take it back.  Also, a good friend of ours purchased the same model and has had numerous issues of their own...with their door components (LCD panel, etc) replaced multiple times.    We love the microwave, but just can't handle the constant breakdowns and huge delays in repair...typically down for a month due to delays in service calls, all parts having to be ordered, then waiting for tech to come back...and in many cases, waiting for them to order more parts. When the unit is down, not only don't you have a microwave, you don't have an exhaust fan, so there's an impact to all of your cooking!    Below is a recap (of the items I could remember) of our Whirlpool adventure:    Microwave Purchased - 9/7/07  Warranty Issues:  6/23/08 - Glass turntable shattered when sizzle pan was heating, LCD display issues  7/1/08 -- Service Call - Parts ordered  7/17/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  8/11/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  8/18/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  9/4/08 - Replaced 17 parts - Issue resolved    Extended (3rd party) Warranty:  1/29/2009 - No display on LCD, unit non-functional  2/?/2009 - Replaced Control board, connector  12/14/2009 - Magnetron not heating/cooling fan not running.  Tech was onsite for approx 5 min, did little/no testing and decided to order AC Filter board (along with previously broken plastic components from earlier repairs)  12/24/2009 - Tech determined incorrect part (AC filter board) ordered, so placed order for 19 additional parts and left with no further action.  1/7/2010 - Replaced 19 parts - didn't fix original issue (Magnetron not heating/cooling fan not running) and caused a new issue - exhaust fan not functioning - this was a 6 hour service call.  Six additional parts ordered - microwave left in pieces and not re-installed on wall.  1/14/10 - Tech replaced 6 additional parts (3 hr call), (LCD control board, upper front plastic frame, magnetron cooling fan, wiring harnesses).  Issue with exhaust fan was determined to be bad new relay control board (replaced on last call).  Tech installed original board (which had a visible burn mark on it and unit worked.  Tech order new relay control board.  - Unit worked when tech's left, however by the end of the day, the display was flashing and non-functional.   1/20/10 - Control board arrived and installed and the exhaust fan did not work, and issue with the LCD was not resolved.  Re-installed original relay control board and exhaust fan worked, LCD issue still occuring.  1/21/10 - Tech attempted to address issues and after having signifigant problems, escalated to advance support.  It ws determined that the unit was not repairable.  2/5/10 - 3rd party warranty company issued a check for the full purchase price of the unit.
[[ASIN:B002X7669C GE JES0736SPSS Stainless Steel Countertop Microwave Oven]  Quick review: Totally satisfied after 8 months of moderate use. Excellent value.    My wife and I looked at every small (-1 cubic ft) microwave at all prices before choosing this one. We have a very small kitchen in our condo and counter space is at a premium. We've had this unit for 8 months and it has performed flawlessly with daily moderate use. We use it mostly for baked potatoes, leftovers, popcorn, defrosting, etc, so we haven't subjected it to heavy use. Although it's only 700 watts, it gets the job done in a reasonable amount of time (2 medium potatoes in 9 minutes). The black/stainless steel casing and classic styling appealled to us also. Our dinner plates fit on the turntable with just a little room to spare.    At this point, I don't think we could be more satisfied with our purchase ($69.95 at Lowes), especially since we considered models 3X the price. Our previous microwave was a space-hogging Montgomery Ward monster we got as a wedding present 25 years ago (thank Gods it finally died) We'll see how this diminutive new GE holds up. I will update this review if we have any issues with it as time goes by.
This black LG over-the-range microwave is just what we needed!  It arrived in good condition with clear directions and fits perfectly.    We're happy customers!
walmart has same model for $63 + $9.97 shipping, i'm a loyal amazon.com shopper, but can't pass that up!!
We bought this, from Amazon, in July.  No issues.  Installed it and it worked great--for less than 4 months.  The microwave stopped working 3 days before Thanksgiving.  Called factory service, 2 weeks.  The appointment is scheduled for 8-12.  They show up at 11:55.  They stay until 2:00--yup it's broke, but we need parts and 2 people.  2 more weeks, parts are shipped to our house and service calls to confirm they are here.  (Factory service that doesn't have parts--interesting way to do business!)  They show up at 11:58--seriously.  Two hours (and another vacation day burned) and the replacement parts are defective.  (Warm fuzzy--not!)  Two more weeks--and they canceled their appointment.  Seems it takes two people to install it and the wonderful factory service only scheduled one.    So the top of the line microwave with convection oven will spend Christmas in the garage.  My newly remodeled kitchen a gaping hole with metal mounting plate for all my guests to admire.    I have e-mailed Whirlpool--will update if and when we get this very frustrating and disappointing mess resolved.    Thinking of buying this brand/item--save yourself--don't!      Update 12-28-09:  Well they canceled their appointment to fix it again.  They now have us waiting another 2 weeks before they can get someone to try and fix it.  Whirlpool customer service contacted us and said the only option we have is to get it fixed, they will not replace their defective equipment.  So it is still sitting in my garage waiting for someone to show up.      The great news is Santa did bring me a microwave to sit on my counter just in case my hopes that the repairmen soon will be here wouldn't happen.  It is a Sharp.  Bare bones model but it works! Santa is a wise man!    Oh--and where will my Whirlpool microwave be spending New Year's?  The garage.    February 28--after 5 more appointments--2 of which they failed to show Whirlpool agreed to replace the microwave.  We have the new one 3 days.  I do enjoy this microwave, I have my fingers crossed it will be reliable.      If you have problems, keep good records, stay with factory authorized service and be persistent.
We bought this microwave (JES2251SJ02) in Jan. of '07. It works pretty well. I like the Inverter defrost capabilities. Recently (Dec. '09) the oven bulb (part# WB36X10302) burnt out. Not a critical problem but a definite pain in the a**. So far my choices in fixing it are:    1) Open it up and poke around trying to fix it myself. Carefully! There's reported to be high voltage capacitors in there that can permanently ruin your day and all your days to come. There is apparently no manual available that will tell you how do do this or what to watch out for.    2) pay for a GE technician to come to the house ($69) and replace the bulb ($12-$20 I think, the GE appointment scheduler doesn't know but I found it online for $11.75) PLUS LABOR.   How much do GE techs charge per hour? GE maint. doesn't know or won't say. How long will it take to complete the job? GE maint. doesn't know or won't say.   Let's estimate that the labor involved takes half an hour to pull the cover off and dismantle the thing enough to get to the bulb and replace it. If the tech charges only $50/hr (probably considerably more) that's a total of $106 (house call + parts + labor). I paid $233 for the thing new. I need to pay almost half the purchase price to fix a burned out bulb 2 yrs later? Time to think about not buying anymore GE appliances.
Just like with the previous reviewer, this microwave worked well until it didn't work at all.  It started turning itself on and then the keypad stopped working.  Since we had bought the house with the microwave, we didn't have the  info we needed to return it but on the instruction manual, the previous owner wrote that it was installed in 2008 and the oven stopped working at the end of 2009.  The manufacture date on the unit said December 2007 so it was less than 2 years old.
This model performed as to be expected... it adequately heated items. After just over one year it suddenly suffered a short and started starting by itself. Additionally, the control pad stopped working. We temporarily overcame the problem by leaving the unit unplugged until needed and it then only sometimes functioned. Perhaps the old adage is correct in you get what you pay for.
I am changing my five star to a one star review.<br /><br />The product cooked food well, but despite gentle use (we read reviews here noting a cracked door), our door has cracked, then cracked again, and then the handle itself has snapped off.  The material quality is very poor.  We were very gentle with this unit, but it's simply a very low quality product.<br /><br />Absolutely do not purchase this.
This is the neatest microwave I have ever worked with. It does everything for you. The controls are easy to use and very easy to see. I can not say enough about the guy we purchased this from. He went above and beyond to make sure we got the microwave before we left town driving from Ca. to OR to meet me.
I purchased this unit to replace a Sharp R-2110JW Smart Carousel which proved to be a piece of junk. What a contrast! For about the same price this unit is much higher quality. The controls are well thought out. The door is designed with the window built in. The Sharp has a plastic overlay glued on that fell off after a couple months. The wall mounting was very easy and straightforward. Overall I couldn't be much happier! LG has won a convert!
This microwave came with our new house.  It started making noises and is now smoking. What happened to microwaves that last??
This microwave is wonderful. The quick heat buttons are convenient and easy to use. If you read Consumer Reports, it says this (or similiar) microwave has only a useful space of 0.9 cubic feet. Not so. This has a full 2.0 cubic feet of space which is great for cooking a ham or a large casserole dish. Very sharp design, useful and adequate lighting underneath. For the installation/do-it-yourselfers: It's 60 pounds and you have to lift it above your shoulders if you are installing over a stove. Follow the instructions to the letter, and all will turn out great. The directions are very good. Note: If you can, remove your stove before installing the microwave. The mfgr doesn't mention this, but it made things a lot easier (and I got to clean under it!)...2-3(-3 preferred) people are definitely needed to install this safely due to its weight and awkward size. I recommend this microwave highly!
I bought this oven to replace a Whirlpool of equal size. I like the LG. It's a little more powerful, and the moisture sensor seems to work pretty well. It's a heavy beast and you will want to use the template that comes with it to lay out the installation bracket positions and holes for the support bolts. Get those right and the installation is no big deal. It does take two people to horse this 60 lb. appliance into place while starting the bolts, threading the cord etc.    It took me a couple of hours from opening the box to firing it up and I was a cabinet installer in my youth. Still, no big deal.    Tip: use a light spray adhesive to attach the layout template to the bottom of upper support cabinet.
The microwave oven arrived on time and in excellent condition.  We have tested it to make sure it works.  It was just installed so we haven't used it a lot yet.....completely happy...excellent Amazon service as usual.
I love this microwave. It was worth waiting for. I had ordered this microwave from 4 other companies that said they had it in stock and then called to tell me they were backordered.Amazon delivered. Thanks
I should have listened to my wife.    I'm about to arrange to take my third Monday afternoon in a row off from work so I can be here for GE's service technician. He's repairing my microwave, which is less than 6 weeks old.     Here's what happened.    Week 1, I call the service center, describe the problem I'm having (power cuts off after a few seconds) and the rep says it's probably an inverter board, and schedules a repair call.    Week 2, The technician arrives, diagnoses the problem and says it's an inverter board. He orders the part.    Week 3,The part has arrived, the repair guy comes to install it, but it's the wrong part. He has to order the right part, I have to take a third day off from work to be available,  and we have to go another week without a microwave.    Wouldn't the RIGHT thing for GE to have done is replace the microwave? Just ship us a new one, and have us ship the old one back? Or have the repair guy make the swap?     That would be showing GE cares about their customer's time, they're concerned if they waste time because of their error, and keeping customers satisfied is its top priority. Instead, GE parrots back the warranty (we only have to repair the appliance, not replace it) and disregards what this experience has meant to its customer and his perception of their company.
I am very disappointed at the poor reliability of this unit.  Ours is less than a year old and has failed--now, when attempting to cook, the unit shuts off before the end of the programmed time.  Even though the light comes on and the turntable turns, the unit does not heat food.  Like others, I purchased this unit based on the recommendation in Consumer Reports; this recommendation didn't pan out.  I tried to schedule warranty service and GE is making us wait a week to schedule and their frustrating telephone system does not provide information on where I can take it for service for faster turnaround (and didn't put me in touch with a live representative).    When the microwave oven worked, it worked fine.  We replaced a Sharp unit with this one; though this unit has the advantage of a larger capacity, its controls are less intuitive.    Based on poor reliability and poor service, we're certainly not going to buy another GE microwave.  We've had good success with GE refrigerators in the past; this is very disappointing.  A quick search on the web now reveals that GE microwave ovens are not reliable--many others appear to have similar problems with the magnetrons.    Perhaps this is one reason why GE is looking to sell its appliance business...
E. J. Tastad's review of this product is accurate and appropriate, but I would like to add some additional information.  I bought this GE Profile microwave oven in March of 2006 on the recommendation of Consumer Reports.  In September 2009 I am sorry to report that I had to throw it out because it wasn't worth repairing.  Consumer Reports gave this GE model their top rating for large microwave ovens.  It replaced an old Amana RadarRange that I had used for about 25 years before it burst into flames.  The Amana had also received Consumer Reports top rating back then.  If I recall, my Amana sold for about twice as much money (in 1981 dollars) as this GE costs in 2006 dollars.<br /><br />Since this microwave oven is more powerful, faster and consumes more electricity than small models, you may need to have a dedicated 20 ampere outlet available for its use.  Compared with my old Amana, the GE has a much more uniform distribution of heat when cooking or reheating, probably because the food is rotated on a turntable.  As E. J. Tastad found, the defrost cycle is easy to use, gives good distribution of heat and the front panel controls are fairly intuitive.  The stainless steel cabinet is attractive and easy to clean.<br /><br />Unlike my old Amana, this oven cannot multi-task.  For example, if you're running the built-in clock timer, you cannot cook or reheat something on a different schedule using different functions.  You must stop the clock timer to begin a cook cycle and vice versa.  You also cannot program several sequences of automatic operations as my old Amana could accommodate, nor can you program it to start at a later time.<br /><br />This microwave oven was not as reliable and did not last nearly as long as my old Amana did.  The magnetron tube in my GE Profile microwave oven failed after two years of use.  It's replacement was covered by the five-year GE warranty on the tube, but the warranty didn't cover the $85 in labor charges, which would have been even more if I had received the service on-site instead of taking the appliance to the appliance repair depot.  After 3 1/2 years of use, (September 2009) the main circuit board self-destructed.  It cost me $44 at the nearest GE repair facility to learn that it would cost me more than another $200 to replace the microwave oven's circuit board.<br /><br />Since other brands of similar-sized and power microwave ovens cost less than the repairs, I have discarded this microwave oven after 3 1/2 years and after spending $129 in diagnostic and repair charges in addition to the purchase price.  Given this experience, I now be hard-pressed to recommend this appliance considering its cost-of-ownership and short life.  This appliance should have lasted much longer.  It did not get heavy use and was never misused or abused.<br /><br />When I contacted GE about my failed microwave oven, they promised to make things right, asked for the model and serial number and requested that I cut off the appliance's power cord and plug and send it to them.  They then sent me a $100 rebate check that could be applied ONLY to another GE appliance purchase.  The check expired before I found another GE appliance that I wanted to own.<br /><br />I bought a replacement, which was a Panasonic model NN-SD978S microwave oven for less than $200 from Sam's Club.  It is just as large, cooks faster and has proven to be far more reliable.  After four years, it's still going strong without need for repairs.ore if I had received the service on-site instead of taking the appliance to the appliance repair depot.

Pros:<br />Large<br />Fast and Even Heating<br />Great Defrost<br />Not too loud<br /><br />Cons:<br />Sensor reheat is only good for soups and other substance that it is okay to heat to boiling (don't trust it with Pizza, or other foods like that).<br /><br />Bottom Line:  This is an excellent large microwave for countertop use.  The inverter defrost works almost perfectly every time, never cooking my food more than it should, but the reheat is a gimmick.<br /><br />This is a large countertop microwave, at about 2.2 cubic foot.  Coming from an over-the-range microwave this is a huge improvement in size.  The microwave heats uniformly and fast (it is 1200 watts).  The sensor reheat should only be used on foods it is safe to boil, otherwise it overcooks about everything else.  It also works best when you lightly cover the food, as sometimes uncovered food triggers it to turn off too early.  Lightly covered is critical, as the sensor works off water vapor temperature being released from the product.  If the water vapor cant leave the container it could become superheated.  Sensor cook should also only be used under supervision (you should be in the same room).<br /><br />I have had the microwave for about 6 months now with no issue.  It is no louder than other microwaves I have used, and the controls are intuitive and easy to use.  You do not have to press a cook button or anything to start your timed cooking.  My favorite feature is the inverter defrost.  Remember you enter the weight in pounds, so for an 8 oz pack of bacon you would enter 5 and start for 1/2 of a pound.  If you had a 1.5 pound package of meat, you would enter 15 and start for 1.5 pounds.  The display shows the weight correctly. Not much else to say about the product, it is a microwave after all.<br /><br />Update: To improve sensor reheat performance, use a lid over the food with a vent hole.  I use a paper plate with a small hole (finger tip size) punched in it.  This will make sure the reheat stays running long enough, but still gets some water vapor to judge the food temperature by so it doesn't over cook.<br /><br />Update (6/26/2010): I have been using the microwave 2 years now.  It has been no issue and still works perfectly.  I use the sensor reheat almost all the time for soups and casseroles, and use the inverter defrost for my frozen goods.  I also use the popcorn button to heat microwave popcorn bags.  Everything has been working great!<br /><br />Update (7/26/2011): Still going strong.  I use the inverter regularly for defrost, or lowering the power level to cook something slower.  It has worked well for me, and I think problems might be from shipping, quality control, or some other factor.<br /><br />Update (3/21/2013): Still going strong, but maybe a bit noisier now.  No issue with inverter function or anything.eheat stays running long enough, but still gets some water vapor to judge the food temperature by so it doesn't over cook.<br /><br />Update (6/26/2010): I have been using the microwave 2 years now.

I have also had the handle melt and the display has failed and become unreadable.
It looks lovely in our stainless steel kitchen, but after only 3 years of use, it has problems. Now the start button doesn't work, but the microwave is on nonstop whenever the door is closed. Started very suddenly. Will have to get it serviced. Great defrost, potato, popcorn functions.
After one year the turntable plate cracked while we were making a bag of popcorn.  Very strange indeed!  Now trying to find a replacement as I really miss the food items turning while cooking!  Other than that it is still working in top notch condition.<br /><br />UPDATE:  This microwave died after only 2 years. Was hoping to get more out of it then we did.
I have had two of these. Both of them had the LCD Display fail and the plastic buttons crack, warp and other wise fail as well.
I purchased my R1510 two years ago. In the first year I had to have unit serviced twice. The second time, which was fortunately two weeks before warranty expired, necessitated a new replacement unit. Well here I am a year later with same failure (some sort of a lightning storm in unit) with no warranty. Needless to say I will be looking else ware!
It may look pretty, but as an over the range microwave oven it provides nothing but headaches. Even a modest amount of heat from the cook top below causes the microwave oven's pushbutton door latch to deform (melt?) because Sharp chose to save money with plastic rather than metal interior parts. Thus, either the door won't close or one has to pry the latch open each time. The service technician who replaced the assembly (twice) said he had performed almost a dozen similar replacements in the recent past. <br /> <br />My advice, buy it only if you never plan to use the cook top below. <br />
Its a pretty big and heavy unit so having someone around to help mount would be a good thing.  I found that sometimes the clips in the back have a little trouble popping in all the way, unless its lined up just right.<br />I didnt like the wall mount screws a whole lot as well as the fact there is only 4 to hold on the whole bracket (they note that you should have at least 2 in studs).  They have holes drilled in the mount all the way across, so what I did was located two studs, drilled some 1/16th pilot holes in the bracket where they were and sunk (5) 1 3/4&quot; drywall screws in each stud from top to bottom of the bracket to attach it to the wall.  I didnt want to worry about the microwave falling off and either seriously injuring someone or smashing my new ceramic top stove.<br />Also be careful if drilling the top cabinet mount holes with the microwave in place, the bit can easily destroy the screw hole :)  I ended up replacing the two small upper cabinet mount screws with 1/2&quot; self tapping bolts.  So the cinnimon powder doesnt quite sit level up there in the cupboard.. but the microwave is definately not falling out of my wall!<br />As for functionality, the microwave is nice and powerful, the unsightly buttons are hidden behind the door (you punch in the settings when you open it).  A note of caution, dont put anything in it without the carousel tray to heat.  I had a small paper nacho bowl in there and it almost started the glue on fire in 20 seconds.<br />Another note... The carousel tray does not ship in this box well, mine arrived broken in half.  My only option was to ship the whole unit back (weighs like 80 lbs).  I lucked out because my old microwave was a Sharp and the carousel tray is identical.
UPDATE: Yes i too had the door latch button melt and it does not function any longer it actually was replaced within the 1st year under warranty but now this has happened again a second time and i was only boiling water on the front burner, i see no use in paying for a second repair since i am currently using a pen to pop the door open i will of course have to replace the whole microwave in the near future & i will be soooo happy when i finally do i can't wait to ditch this appliance what a waste. next time I'm choosing a regular handle not a push button latch. Live & Learn   don't they test these designs in practical applications before releasing them to the consumer.....won't be buying anything from sharp company any time soon.   I purchased this microwave to replace a countertop model (emerson proffesional) stainless steel, I needed a spacesaving feature plus vent for stove and wanted stainless steel to match my other stainless steel appliances.  I purchased it from Amazon for $275. lowest price I could find and am currently waiting on a $30.rebate from sharp so for the price its not a bad deal.  It has no handle that makes it sleek looking and the control panel is hidden behind the door not used to having to set controls before closing door but it makes cleaning easier.  My countertop model was of higher quality stainless steel and i only paid $100. for it (on all sides) not just the front like this model  I installed this unit to vent vertically outside the damper is a bit flimsy but hopefully its been tested by sharp for reliability.  Exhaust fan unit detects heat from stove and automatically operates, unit is a bit noisy on either hi or low setting,wish it was quieter.The light has hi and low settings either is bright enough, more of a night light feature.  Overall it work fine and looks good. Not a high end unit but then again not a high end price.  It does have a nice feature that senses when your food is cooked, used it on potatoes which turned out great.At first I was reluctant to purchase this larger appliance that would be shipped through UPS for fear it would arrive damaged but UPS did a fine job with handling.  Rated it 3 stars as unit being average and appearance bearing clean lines which boosted my rating.
